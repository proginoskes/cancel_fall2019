Gabbard denounces “cancel culture,” referring to a veteran and college student who told her he was uncomfortable telling people he was a Republican.
What these cancel culture sjw types don’t get is that they are creating an emotional reaction from our already passionate fan base. Emotional triggers make people buy. My businesses are thriving due to their efforts.
If you can’t look back on old tweets and cringe at the things you’ve said, then you are playing too safe.  In a world of cancel culture it’s scary to possibly say the wrong thing.  But, I’ve found that saying the “wrong” thing and having an open mind is the fastest way to grow.
Cancel Culture doesn't exist, but I've seen online drags modify behavior.
Cancel Culture is real?
Cancel culture goes after Bret Stephens of the @nytimes.  But, as @jhinderaker notes at @powerlineUS, the revolution always eats its own.  https://t.co/4QjTVK7nzF
Cancel culture can be seen as an extension of call-out culture.  But while these ideas seem interchangeable at a glance, they're important in different ways:  https://t.co/W04r9H0z3l

@graeme_0 Did ya even read the article? Because what you’re doing right here is exactly the culture it’s describing. Did I endorse every thing Quillette has ever said? No. Just a link to one article. Don’t be a part of cancel culture.
@ConkyOCE Are you saying to cancel cancel culture
@JaredReinfeldt so tired of this cancel culture...
As others have said, it’s cancel culture. Don’t debate. Just cancel your subscription.

@ProfessorBLove One of the few instances I wish cancel culture were real cuz I’m sick of seeing her and her shenanigans.
@CKWebb73 @GuysLame @ljmontello @Shiki_Baby_Bat It's a little bit reductive, CK, some dickhead rapid firing my "sins" at you in an attempt to scare you away from a positive movement that counters the destructive Cancel Culture efforts of people like that particular dickhead.  If you hate SJWs &amp; Cancel Culture, you're with me!

But here’s the thing. The only evidence the show of this alleged growth is him saying he has grown, his wife saying he has grown &amp; 1 white gay employee saying he has grown. Which brings be back to the simple fact that cancel culture doesn’t exist. It’s not a real thing.
a suggestion 4all those who discovered the word Toxic in 2018 2019 could U plz dead this word in 2020 or find a new one.Nomore PC culture and only cancel CULTURE 4 Rapists , peadophiles and Child Murderers please A MAN SAID FUCK ETC ETC 10 yrs ago leave the man to have his job
@EasyLivin247365 I appreciate the kind words. I'm not sure what cancel culture is. As for whether it's news, discrimination shouldn't be ignored. I respect your opinion that you think this is worthy of my news feed. I do, and I believe others will agree.
Cancel culture is wack, people that don't like you for whatever reason will twist the truth and derive it to the point where it's not even close to true anymore. Make sure you know how to read through Theseus' Ship arguments and offer support to your friends if they're under fire
@PrincessOtC @estarianne @gvvstav @windes @brooklynmarie @nytopinion Leftists can easily be Red Fascist because they crave power and get a rush from projecting their narcissistic rage mob into cancel culture and authoritarian control in place of real rigor.
@estarianne @PrincessOtC @gvvstav @windes @brooklynmarie @nytopinion You know your racial inquisition doesn’t work anymore, that woke tactic is so old it’s in the garbage burning right now. Your cancel culture BS has failed. And your substitute for intellectual rigor shows you’re not the arbiter of who is “anything” but thanks for playing.
youtubers trying to navigate conflict during the rise of cancel culture
@GabbieHanna This is the RIGHT way to rectify these situations - a coherent explanation and apology. Anyone who tries to argue the apology is a part of cancel culture and represents a much larger issue than a bad joke.
@BVTech @CorrectAndrew @DrDebraSoh @TransRadically @transadvocate @UKTransadvocate Debra Soh is missing serval things in her analysis and these folks don’t engage in cancel culture.  Sorry but nice try.
@northernluke I choose where to put my pounds. That is simply me choosing to cancel the support of an artist’s work. If enough people do that I guess it’s cancel culture. Public shaming is pack-mentality viciousness. I think they’re different things. Somewhere in the mix is no-platforming too.
Cancel culture is predicated on  an opinion. It’s bullying people out of a job based on an assumption a few words or a liked tweet. This is obscene and most of these people being targeted are women. No cause justifies pitch fork and flaming torch diplomacy.
Anyway if cancel culture worked, Bret Stephens would have been fired for using his privileged access to an NYT column to compare someone to a Nazi for making a schoolyard joke about him.
So my impression of twitter after a two week break is  1. A lot of bad hot takes from smart people, including QTPOC that I would hope know better  2. The Judith Butler donation piece in Jacobin was trash 3. Twitter has a tear down culture problem, not a cancel culture problem
@Mahyaaaar I think holding people to honest standards is important. I sent that tweet earlier b/c I saw a flurry of tweets that were talking abt remarks on Libya &amp; it felt like “cancel” culture to me. And I found it suspect since I hadn’t seen any of those accounts tweet abt Nouri arrest.
@roddreher honestly deserved. cancel culture goes precisely far enough.

Cancel Culture is an artform.
Cancel culture is at it again.
My fav thing is about all the pieces on how scary(?), bad(?) cancel culture is, is that even the critics admit that it’s confined to Twitter, and yet they write columns and columns about it like it’s caused the deaths of 100’s people.
You would think the country is not slipping into facism the way people have been crying about “cancel culture”
They did it with George Takei, they did it with Andrew Yang, they’ve done it to me, and they’re doing it to so many others. Cancel culture is fine if only the guilty get punished. But destroying innocent people’s lives based on rumor and innuendo is both unjust and inhumane.

@AverageG4merYT Then be nuanced, man. Ditch the "STFU" crap. I think cancel culture sucks too.  As far as JK, she stepped in it. As I understand it, the lady who was let go didn't just make one little mess up. There was a pattern of bigot-flavored behavior.
@AverageG4merYT Dude, cancel culture *does* need to check itself. Certainly.  But to lash out at trans people in the process of sharing that opinion? And to do it agressively? Bro, I've kept my cool. You haven't.  Doesn't that make you the snowflake?  Calm yourself.

Haha that’s where the business comes in ...  But The same rule should apply for every channel that has something/someone u don’t like then.   That’s pretty much cancel culture, I detest that.  Just don’t watch them.  That’s to everyone in general btw.

@kserp10_NYG_ "Cancel culture" is a made up phrase for people who don't want there to be consequences of offensive actions. ... Also, show me where I said he shouldn't work anymore. I'll wait. It'll take you a long, long time.

@davidflatman What does it say about Twitter, 'cancel culture' and the online 'mob' that lots of really reasonable, compassionate, thoughtful people are fearful of offering an opinion on a sensitive topic?  I'm also staying quiet too, mind.
@Saint_NattyW @patyrmiranda This is an especially silly case for "cancel culture" complaints because the only reason people are talking about it today is that she went and scrubbed her Tumblr. Who's fault is that?
@patyrmiranda @Saint_NattyW Yeah cancel culture is so extreme she had a #1 single, a #3 album, a Grammy nomination, and two VMAs this year lol
@Triiiclops_013 Society wasn't always like this. The (cancel) culture became weaponized at some point, catching some people in the crosshairs that didn't deserve it. There is also the failure of allowing atonement, ever, and those who are outright wronged, never get their due process.  Its weak.

Alt-right white supremacists and ultra-woke liberals may be diametrically opposed when it comes to politics, but they do share a few things in common. They are both extreme, form echo chambers, and love bullying others on social media with cancel culture mobs.
@AnaKasparian @cenkuygur People don’t speak out about this because they’re scared of the backlash they too will receive. So this self-censorship allows cancel culture to become a reign of terror like McCarthyism on social media. It’s very authoritarian, lacking in due process, and scary for Americans.
@AnaKasparian @cenkuygur Cancel culture isn’t about finding bad guys and bringing them to justice. It’s about accomplishing a political objective and rewarding those who participate in the mass bullying with social media clout. Conservatives exploit this weakness in liberals like a Trojan horse.
@cenkuygur Please use your platform to speak out about how white supremacy and cancel culture can sometimes intersect—resulting in a strange convergence of forces between factions of woke liberals and bad faith alt-right actors.
@ajs Cancel culture doesn't allow for it. Everyone wants black and white answers unfortunately. Short term satisfaction with the pitchfork and they move onto the next.

something lost in the whole “cancel culture” debate is that yes, people can learn &amp; change. but they have to actually do it. and part of that is accepting that for a while you just have to listen to all the people who are mad at you and they don’t have to immediately forgive you

Both sides have rallying cries:  “Intolerant of intolerance”  “Cancel cancel culture”  Both oxymorons &amp; linguistic contradictions  What they’re ultimately about is safety — ppl don’t want to be discriminated against. Ppl don’t want to be purged from society without due process

My act of defiance in this outrage cancel culture is to give love to ‘problematic’ celebrities. They’re human beings who were born from a mother just like you. You want to hate someone for doing something you disagree with? See how that hatred affects you and doesn’t touch them.
55 year old black lady just hit me with the “Look at your jacket... that’s different.”   This is the only cancel culture I recognize. Devastating.

And yes, the ambassador who cancelled is indeed appalled by cancel culture. I didn't thread the links last night, so here goes

"Cancel culture" or not if there is an issue that is causing a certain group of people to feel uneasy or unsafe about going to your tournament then you as a TO (or the you as a community member of that tournament) should want to remedy said issues.
Also, regular reminder that cancel culture has no power if organizations and people can just grow more of a spine. The Sanders campaign, if they believed in their staffer's integrity/change of heart, could have just kept the guy instead of kowtowing. I mean, really, guys.
My actual opinion is that cancel culture does suck and of course people deserve the opportunity to learn and grow! but  if you take a moment, it is really REALLY easy to tell who is willing to grow and who has a vested interest in, and history of, being hateful both online &amp; off

@dperkinsed Absent of actual strong examples and a cogent understanding of actual cancel culture, it seems you’re impeding the truth you’re seeking to find. Be good to yourself.
@dperkinsed 3) I’m not sure you’re actually concerned with “cancel culture” if you’re confusing it for actual accountability for racist / sexist / ableist wrongs perpetuated by folx more powerful.
@dperkinsed 1) I just read the article you sent. She leapt to the conclusion that someone won and was laughed at. How’s that cancel culture? 2) You’re equating ethnic studies, charter school firing, and a woman who was jeered. Still not following your logic.

So Charles Barkley apologizes for making an obviously distasteful joke and Axios reporter @Alexi doesn’t think he deserves forgiveness. But it’s ok for her to make racist jokes about Asians. Hypocritical and disgusting. Problem with woke/cancel culture, it always boomerangs back.  https://t.co/PwqqVLyggW
I am happy to see an artistic movie succeed though, especially when all the cancel culture reviewers were trying their hardest to get people not to watch.

One flaw in social media as a political medium--besides "cancel culture" blah blah--is that it doesn't really equip people to contend with or argue to people who aren't influenced by shaming or worry abut exclusion from a certain group.

It's possible I skimmed a sentence somewhere in the middle that I shouldn't have, but everything described in this piece on high school "cancel culture" seems benign, even healthy, to me.

Straight truth: I'm on Twitter a lot less than I once was because its become condemnatory to an alarming degree. Cancel culture is schoolyard bullshit on a new platform.

@NoLore When it's someone he disagrees with, cancel culture is super ok.
dave rubin (who is gay himself) is canceling chic fil a because they "caved to cancel culture" and stopped donating to anti lgbt charities. this is your brain on conservatism.
@Kentriley Cancel culture doesn’t exist. It’s a myth invented by white guys.

The left cancel culture which seeks to destroy people completely for their opinions usually comes back to bit them them in their own backside.
Ben Shapiro and Dave Rubin calling Chick Fil A's previous donations to homophobic organizations "resisting cancel culture" is hilarious (and a good example of why the term itself is a misnomer).

I'm not sure I want the right to get into this cancel culture thing.   Not only do I not see where it says Chick-fil-A will discontinue working with anti-LGBT groups, it just says they're becoming more focused on certain areas.   I think the anti-LGBT thing was inferred by CNBC.
@benshapiro So you post about hating cancel culture while telling your dumbfuck followers to cancel Chick Fil-A.  You are the dumbest motherfucker on this planet.
There is so much hysteria masked as analysis from white journalists on ‘outrage’ culture, cancel culture, ‘tribalism’, etc etc it’s so boring and predictable and frankly so oblivious.
@MichaelSholun @RandyOrton @TonyKhan @CMPunk @WWEonFOX @VinceMcMahon I don’t at all think he should be “canceled” nor do I believe in “cancel culture” but to think it isn’t relevant to the conversation is dumb

Interesting. I would say that kitsch, as an aesthetic, doesn’t excuse you for being gay and taking a glamor shot at the Jewish Memorial. Kitsch is amoral by definition. But cancel culture is absurd, and it’s possible to exaggerate the offense. 🤷‍♂️ Anyone? Read the piece first, pls

Doesn't the Conservative establishment realize that the left still won't vote for them no matter how much they disavow people?  Sure, you should call out bad ideologies and bad opinions. But you shouldn't participate in cancel culture. That is not conservative.

Mir und anderen wird vorgeworfen, wir würden ein Geschäft daraus machen: Ich glaube, das ist falsch. Speziell die Cancel Culture verdeutlicht den Lesern, dass sie sich nolens volens engagieren müssen, wenn er weiter eine andere Sichtweise haben wollen.
One of the best political reporters in the nation getting subjected to progressive cancel culture. The story writes itself in the Year of Our Lord 2019.

The decision makes absolutely no sense. @ChickfilA was actually cool because it stood up to the progressive mind virus which is cancel culture.   I’m not going back to that sad, dry, pathetic Burger King chicken sandwich. No way, no how.  Back to the home cooked frying pan...
“Cancel culture will stop when the extremists are gone, it’s not a slippery slope.”  Meanwhile, a chicken sandwich restaurant founded by Christian conservatives cancels the Salvation Army.

tl;dr: When people respond to something, but you don't like what they have to say, it's not automatically a "call-out."  When people face consequences for their choices or actions, but you don't like the consequence, it's not automatically a result of "cancel culture"
Why aren't IDW-types defending Malkin against being "cancelled"?  What makes her being fired from YAF a consequence, rather than "another example of cancel culture!"   Because it can't be pinned on "the Left"?

Saw this coming. Instead of hating #DisneyPlus 4 the disclaimer, let's appreciate they even bothered. I agree #cancelculture is sometimes obnoxious but just b/c it doesn't personally affect/trigger you doesn't mean it's the same 4 others. Let's try 2 be a little more empathetic.

@wbla2310 @jessieraeallen @TheSocialCTV I don't condone that at all. Our cancel culture is not healthy. I can strongly disagree with someone's incorrect generalizations, but I don't need them fired over it. In fact I see no benefit in that. Discussions are where we learn, not firings.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but a huge part of the furor has to do with needing five years to reach these conclusions. It's not about cancel culture or making sure Kapler never works again. It's about honestly owning an egregious judgment lapse. Not sure if that happened before this
Enough with the never ending outrage machine. Don’t agree with @jessieraeallen don’t watch. She’s entitled to her opinion. Period. As am I, you. And yes Don Cherry.  Time to cancel “cancel” culture. It’s growing old real fast.
Disagree. That's the cancel culture of the left. Conservatives should be made of sterner stuff -- refuting arguments we disagree with, not censoring them. Here, by noting the irony of someone who accuses Cherry of being a bigot restoring to the very tactics she claims to deplore.

That’s honestly a really good point. I wonder if they have a delay? Smart tweet man. I know I do. Something to consider and look into for anyone who may say something cancel culture doesn’t agree with.

Further, it's more than amusing that those claiming he's a victim of "cancel culture" are in full support of his attempt to shame people into a form of virtue signaling.
As for those pointing to this decision as evidence of "cancel culture" -- it seems Cherry was given a choice., and knowing the consequences, he made it.  Again, his own words remain the problem, not the response or the consequences.
@bellastone Trudeau did black face but he's still the PM. People were falling over themselves to explain it away. This is about left vs. right and cancel culture more than about what he said. He's an old man that no one takes seriously, but still an icon. Let him ride off into the sunset.

@LLCFertco More so speaking to the cancel culture idea than the fact they’re still figuring out how the business model works at scale. I see them getting big contracts for things like trucking soon, especially with autonomous vehicles. Those will be silent money makers for them.
@my_realtor_dave He’s been doing bad delivery for decades. And paid handsomely for it. Now the cancel culture turns on him like his employers do who no doubt encouraged him to be “his” way for ratings and as dollars.
I’m one of “those” people. He reminded me. I don’t see it all. &amp; I’m on my way to the Remembrance Day celebration now too. I probably wouldn’t have gone hadn’t  it been for his comments Saturday night &amp; the cancel culture backlash. I wonder how many have used it for good like me?

What some of y'all call "cancel culture", I call resistance .  --against having our lives literally disregarded and erased.
Real "cancel culture" is:  -Being killed for resisting government oppression - Being blacklisted for speaking out against racism -Excessive police violence -Being killed or attacked for your gender identity/sexual orientation -Being left to die because you can't afford healthcare

A weird problem with “cancel culture”—an actual problem, not this Oh No Poor Sex Pests shit—is that people whose exposure predates the current wave just... keep on a-chugging. Victor Salva’s still making movies, Harold Bloom wasn’t criticized above a hush until he died, etc
Most people will advocate for cancel culture until they're the ones on the wrong side.

@mistahbuhau I also very specifically do not like the term "cancel culture," however am aware it is one people use  https://t.co/yZtQLizuNE
@mistahbuhau no... I'm saying that is what a person like myself is referring to when referencing the phrase "cancel culture"
in fact, I would be very deliberate in saying "I think when people say 'cancel culture' they are specifically referring to things that are NOT as consequential as exposing predatory behavior"
what people are calling "cancel culture" and exposing predators are not 1:1, these are not the same thing, and we should not treat them like the same thing
#CancelCulture strikes again - we have a Christmas tree at our house, too. Not a holiday tree. #1A in jeopardy.
this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what people are referring to when they say "cancel culture," not that I think it is a good term  also, "consequences" has become a very malleable word in order to excuse abuse towards people who have been stalked and misrepresented  https://t.co/1oxGmSvW8z

not sure why we don't refer to cancel culture as "taking a vacation from the internet," which sounds actually great?

i know cancel culture is a touchy subject, and that being a subject of it gives me a biased pov. but here it is. i believe that people should be given the opportunity to hold themselves accountable. i also think continued public harassment has tragic side effects. it's violence.
the real cancel culture is the ways victims are punished for daring to ask for help. we are constantly ostracized and gaslit for telling the truth.  but no one cared because we don’t have any power.

"Cancel culture is a white supremacist dog whistle" is an example of the kind of bullshit the 2012-era "left" would say as it yelled at some individual nerd at a movie theatre for what film they were seeing...  You know, just before the right took over every branch of government.

the only reason to say "cancel culture" is because that is what everyone knows it as, it is a term that gets a lot of attention, and it is an ongoing conversation that can be tapped into and explained with *actual criticism* of the ruling class's justifying ideology
cancel culture, as I have taken the time to carefully describe in my video, is a bad name for competitive ideology (stuff that exists everywhere in capitalism) manifesting as a solution to problems that are sometimes real, sometimes fake

One big problem w/cancel culture is this illusion of holding powerful people accountable via dredging up old tweets or w/e. In reality those who run society aren't on social media (w/a few exceptions). Cancel culture mobs tend to focus largely on minor trolls &amp; innocent nobodies.

Identity politics = never applied to white men or mainstream. Cancel culture = only applied when criticizing white men or mainstream. Woke= co-opted by white men/mainstream as pejorative when criticized.  Obama using this one-way language was either deliberate or out of touch.

Accountability for an individuals misdeeds is important, however, I too have often found the notion of cancel culture and those on the journey to being more “woke” than all others are more divisive and often less happy than any other. Wise words from President Obama.

We need to learn how to communicate with our friends when they do cross the line.  Approach your friends to teach them the right way with love.  Attacking people just creates more people who will jump on the cancel culture bus the next time something happens.
Being “cancelled” has many meanings &amp; is worthy of serious linguistic &amp; sociological study as a concept. But when ppl w great formal power (presidents! columnists with lifelong tenure!) complain about “cancel culture” they’re only meaning “disobedience to the status quo.”

Cancel culture isn't a myth because people don't call for others to be cancelled, it's total bullshit because it's attributed to the left.   It's not difficult to make a long list of people who have been cancelled for running afoul of conservative political correctness.  https://t.co/bgEzctVk9T
A couple’s “costume” with a predator and one of his abuse victims in 2019 is just another example showing cancel culture doesn’t exist. (But rape culture sure does)
The problem with cancel culture is that the focus lense is so short sighted.  We see someone we generally don’t know be publicly dragged for doing one wrong thing.  Save cancel culture for people who repeatedly do wrong.  Everyone can make mistakes and learn from them.
I’m with three women at breakfast and none of them have heard of cancel culture and have I mentioned how important it is to have friends who don’t live online?

The #CancelCulture phenomenon will continue to have real consequences for awhile. But the word "cancel" itself will soon be rendered meaningless, the verbal equivalent of kids making a gun shape with their fingers and saying "bang, you're dead."
So many think pieces about “cancel culture!” I think stuff about it too but the main thing is that nobody has managed to actually cancel anyone. At most, we’ve put people on hiatus before they come back with an all-new season of episodes.
The term “cancel culture” is only used to punch down. It’s about people with too much power feeling a bit of narcissistic injury and attributing it to some pernicious force...when it’s just a part of living in a society.  Have they not heard of exile??
Isn’t it funny how bosses can ruin lives with their greed and personal vendettas, abusers successfully ostracize their abusers, cis people actively make deadly transphobic policies...but none are deemed victims of “cancel culture” 🤔
I mean if other people want to be friends with him I guess 🤷🏼‍♀️ but, like, yeah, dude, you cheat on your wife like that and your party invites are gonna dry up in your former social circles. That’s how shit fucking works. Glomming onto “cancel culture” just says we weren’t wrong.

Complaining About Cancel Culture Paid for My Second Home: a memoir.
@Okwonga Agree, no one is perfect but people should be proactive about becoming better. There’s a lot of received wisdom / status quo that would go unchallenged if people didn’t put their head above the parapet and call it out. To dismiss that as ‘cancel culture’ I think is not productive
For me, cancel culture is very real - 18 months after my “incident” (you know, condemning today’s tolerated acceptance of racism, and standing up for free speech in art) I still deal with effects of being “blacklisted” and people interfere with every chance I have to make money.
Thread. I think a lot of "cancel culture" really runs along the same old tramlines of bigotry. The people who get hounded are the same as they ever were - those underlying dynamics haven't truly changed, I don' think. As for nuance, I agree there, for sure.
Cancel culture is corny. I’ve seen s people and brands canceled, yet they’re still as relevant as ever because the internet has an attention span of a goldfish.
The only people with reasonable concern about cancel culture are assholes who don’t know how to take responsibility. I don’t even know who this person is or what he got dragged for, but what a great tweet!

It’s not that Obama didn’t have a point, it’s just very interesting what he chooses to emphasise. Cancel culture is by no means the left’s biggest problem because those who want to do the work always will, whether they are “cancelled” or not.
it’s almost as if “cancel culture” is just holding people accountable for bad decisions and when it happens to decent people they learn from the mistake graciously instead of being victimized assholes about it forever.
I agree with his points on the cancel culture criticism of Obama. Obama is way too heavy handed with it and it serves no one. It was the whole one generation hero ball point I disagree with

@cartergill True, but the blanket condemnation sounds so out of touch and self righteous to me  Examples of cancel culture gone amuck abound...the one that sticks with me is the woman who made a bad joke about not getting AIDS before takeoff and got fired/internet mob shamed by landing. 🤦🏼‍♀️
The stone casters of cancel culture land who constantly have to find new ways to add "phobia" to things as a put-down need to find a lexicon one day.  Example: Just because I rarely drink alcohol doesn't mean I'm irrationally afraid of it. Just like most vegans aren't carnophobes

@garynahrep I don’t think people are asking for perfection. People are here simply telling others to stop destroying lives. We have to be careful with words with use here but they don’t have to on those stages? The hypocrisy is astounding. Cancel culture is a mild annoyance to them.
what account was the first account to tweet the phrase “cancel culture” and in what context did they tweet it?
These are some solid observations about cancel culture. Some of which @jameelajamil also touched on recently.

@garynahrep Cancel culture hasn’t really cancelled many people. Many barbaric men still have fruitful jobs. Some even get elected to the White House. Others are getting speaking engagements and deals. We’re sold propaganda from left to right but the bad guys are the kids online.
*sigh* Cancel culture only exists in the fevered imaginations of powerful white men.

Yesterday I was asked for my insights on #CancelCulture, and I was honest. While I’m all for accountability, demanding the elimination of aspects of culture or people is counterintuitive to societal growth &amp; understanding. Don’t agree with me? Here’s another POV. #WednesdayWisdom
@ririwillicms The first part of her statement is incredibly ignorant. Lots of folks who’ve been canceled - some who didn’t do anything wrong - are not “back”. They are not the same mentally. They do not have it easy in the slightest. There is no “cancel culture” is the wrong take to share.

Obama is right, but he's not criticizing "cancel culture" alone (whatever you think that is). He's criticizing attempts to force normal people into black-and-white good/evil boxes, because most humans are more complicated than that and shouldn't be reduced to their worst tweet.

White, right-wing men have ruined the lives of MANY people online, women in particular, and trolled them right out of public life. We don't call that "cancel culture," because they're "supposed" to have social power.
The people who supposedly do "cancel culture" are specifically the people who are not supposed to have social power. They are generally marginalized in some way or another.

Cancel culture, when based on accusations over facts and evidence, is a form of extreme psychological bullying on social media. It’s a type of pure violence that must itself be cancelled. Everyone, even doctors sworn to do no harm, participate in these craven acts. Terrifying.

Cancel culture is a thing they made up to talk about black women and how it’s wielded exemplifies that every day
Also, this was a showcase for up &amp; coming performers. Great having a powerful guy there who raped &amp; harassed up &amp; coming performers for decades. They really boo’d that woman for saying something &amp; kicked the other one out. Cancel culture doesn’t exist. What DOES exist...
Wow. So a comedian got up &amp; started talking about Harvey being there &amp; she was booed. Then another woman was escorted out because she said she “didn’t want to stand next to a fucking rapist. No one’s gonna say anything?!” But cancel culture amirite???

@frazbelina Cancel culture exists on Twitter and that's it.
@HannaFlint Cancel culture is real though... *insert every eye-roll and look of disgust ever*
@KimberlyNFoster cancel culture
Lmaooo “cancel culture.” Harvey Weinstein is still getting invited to events and Roman Polanski-known child rapist since the 1970s- won an award last month. Eagerly awaiting Pol Pot’s inevitable comeback
Harvey Weinstein is hanging with pals. Aziz is putting out specials. Louis is doing sets at comedy clubs. But yes please keep complaining about how cancel culture ruins men’s lives.
literally fuck EVERYONE that complains about cancel culture. this motherfucker is a well-established MONSTER that propelled the #MeToo movement and ppl out here still defending him and letting him back in environments where he abused his power.
I really don't want to hear one more thing about men being victimized by "cancel culture"
Reports of #CancelCulture have been greatly exaggerated.  https://t.co/5H4aTqY89D
1. Head's up to everyone in NY to stay away from Downtime Bar 2. These women were brave as hell 3. Don't mention "cancel culture" to me again when the ONE person we pretty much all agreed was an irredeemable sack of shit is out, having fun, WITH PEOPLE DEFENDING HIM. Infuriating
But sure, "cancel culture" is the problem

"cancel culture" lol  https://t.co/1uqD4X4qzr
"Cancel culture" has never been a real thing, with the living, disturbing proof being that Harvey Weinstein gets invited to exclusive NYC events and has people doing his dirty work when anyone dares imply that he's a monster.
Apparently so called "cancel culture" means he stayed inside and women protesting his presence were kicked out.
The next time someone pointlessly lectures you about how "cancel culture" has gone too far, please refer them back to the way this comedian is greeted for confronting Harvey Weinstein, a literal monster. I can't stop watching this.
@OneDropSoup @Kduff79 Oh, as in “cancel culture”... I get it now. Yeah, I agree. “Stop buying” is a better way to put it.
@TheCut I'm not a cancel culture proponent, but I'll make an exception for everyone accompanying Harvey, inviting Harvey, kicking these women—rape survivors!—out when they challenged him attending a forum for emerging artists, ie his hunting grounds.  https://t.co/tRheIETeIr

Anyone no ones life has been ruined by being canceled even the woman the book So Youve Been Publicly Shamed got her job back at the same company so where’s this cancel culture
This is definitely not "cancel culture", this is consequence culture.  You don't get to act like that and keep your job in an #MLB front office. He's too replaceable.  Sadly, the determination was made that Osuna is not. That's a whole other societal issue.
women get bounced out of a comedy show for calling out harvey weinstein but cancel culture is the problem  https://t.co/MfMyve8vRf
Last night, Harvey Weinstein was invited to a fundraiser for actors and when female attendees asked for him to leave, the women were kicked out. So yeah, cancel culture, not a thing  https://t.co/a9z1BUB9zm
Stuff like this is why so many Americans rightly consider our media culture to be parasitic... except a lot of people go along with or even encourage it when it happens to their enemies. Only way to stop cancel culture is to oppose it uniformly.
And this is why we have problems like "Cancel Culture" the lack of Critical Thinking ability among the lowest common denominator, combined with everyone having a platform and the ability to grow an audience, with no qualification or standard applied to what they present...
It's good to remember that as much as we talk about cancel culture and how it's destroying the world, no one is ever really canceled. Weinstein is facing criminal charges and he's still not fully canceled.

Why is it that the people mad about cancel culture are the same people that canceled the Dixie Chicks, which yes, I am still mad about.
@realDonaldTrump When Trump starts calling people human scum and bullies others so viciously, he inspires his own supporters first and then everyone else on social media to follow his lead. We are now living in a cancel culture where intense bullying and vicious attacks are the norm. Horrifying.

@naomialderman “Cancel culture” is a big complicated topic but it *is* true that things move far too quickly for normal humans to deal with. Maybe there should be an app or AI assistant that says, “Hello, my human is in emotional distress and cannot respond now, but they’ve heard you.”

Cancel culture is not a thing it’s constantly weaponized usually by non black women to avoid critique .
Cancel culture is so unhelpful.
Cancel Culture makes me sick.
@Ryan_Bell98 @HardDriveMag This is the kind of CANCEL CULTURE that makes people main Hanzo.
Solving this problem is genuinely challenging, because the dominant 'marketplace of ideas' model of free expression requires something that looks exactly like 'cancel culture' to work. 'The best ideas emerge triumphant' means the worst ideas get vanquished, 'cancelled.'
I ordinarily put 'political correctness' &amp; 'cancel culture' in scare quotes. That's because the single greatest problem in such discourse today is the inability to distinguish between public criticism &amp; censorship, or 'PC' &amp; the 'marketplace of ideas' functioning as it should.

Mainstream hysteria about cancel culture is about the powerless, about IBPoC having the tools to call out racism, misogyny &amp; a host of other oppressions.  They fear the powerful being called to account, not cancellation, because pretty much no one in power has been cancelled.
But attacks on WoC doesn't get coverage in the mainstream media as cancel culture.  That pretty much didn't get any coverage at all until very recently when what they'd been saying for years--that they were being targeted by Russian trolls--was proved to be true by white people.
What is described as cancel culture for the most part is people who didn't previously have a voice criticising people with way more power than them. People like L*uis C*K.  Social media has also been harnessed to go after people like @Blackamazon and @Karnythia and many others.

Historically the most effective cancel culturs have been those of governments. Particularly authoritarian ones.  Russia has a cancel culture stretching back to the czars.  Pinochet was huge on cancelling his opponents.  Apartheid South Africa. Nazi Germany. The Khmer rouge. Etc.

“Cancel Culture” in America now includes shutting people down who criticize a murderous Communist regime in a foreign country.   And professional athletes, who are often seen as being a voice for “social justice,” are openly sucking up to the Commies.   That’s where we’re at.

@Nicholasvanj No: it was a general statement - perhaps delivered clumsily - I did not intend to single you - but you acknowledge you were definitely part of it.  The left are only waking up to unhelpful nature of cancel culture now that the monster they unleashed has come back to hurt them.

@Nicholasvanj Fighting for someone’s right to exist is reasonable. Fighting to stop people being vilified is also laudable. fighting for a right not to feel “offended” isn’t.  This is a pretty important distinction. I’m sure you would recognise that most cancel culture is in the last category.

@JeanLeggett Like most things in black &amp; brown culture that become mainstream (woke is another example) the original intent is often watered down.  Cancel culture is consequences for crappy actions. I'm all for restorative justice if done right but rarely are folks sincere when making amends.
@JeanLeggett Cancel culture at its core was initially for marginalized communities to be able to call out people for racism, sexism, problematic behavior etc.  It was so we could give a heads up to others about what was going on so folks could protect themselves &amp; their networks.
As the debate over “cancel culture” continues to rage, it’s worth identifying the roots of this phenomenon:  Don't try to patch it up Tear it up, tear it up! Wash him out, dry him out, Push him out, fly him out, Cancel him and let him go! Yea, sister!

“When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.”- a quote to playback to trite critiques of “cancel culture”   #MayaAngelou
@Noahpinion Ostracism as a method of control does have the advantage of usually having an idea in mind. Cancel culture honestly has power dynamics at its base — which is why it seems egalitarian.  But everyone is scared to be next. Moving into the vacuum is obviously crazy. Only crazy does.
(Also "cancel culture" is a bad phrase made by people who want it to seem bad)
This is also why I suspect I have a different and less threatened perspective on "cancel culture" than some other dudes of my ilk. If you've benefited from unearned advantages and built success on the culture that allows it, maybe don't be surprised when that bill comes due.

Good thread worth reading, though I disagree with most of its recommendations. (IMHO, we must fight cancel culture tooth and nail, not acquiesce to a new meta-norm of imposing ideological fads &amp; virtue-signaling norms by social media mob rule.)
@bungarsargon @nytopinion They can, but they won't. We no longer live in a place where ideas can be debated. We now have a Cancel Culture &amp; Safe Spaces that need to be protected from any thoughts that threaten our politics. What we read, what we watch, even who we associate with, are all deeply polarized.
I mean, trying to have an event to debate with people over whether or not cancel culture and deplatforming is real but you already win the debate without the event even happening is pretty fucking handy not gonna lie.

The thing with all the outrage about “cancel culture” is that cancel culture isn’t real, and everyone who is “canceled” just resurfaces after a bit.  But if that’s true, then how is the “canceling” actually holding anyone accountable, and how does it differ from harassment?
16/Also, social media cancel culture will rid us of all our heroes.  We will no longer be able to imagine that people like Gandhi were saints. We will be forced to realize that they were just flawed, fallible, occasionally amazing but  occasionally awful human beings.
15/Social media cancel culture has raised the social status value of being an average schmo, and reduced the value of being a big shot.  Maybe, in this age of rampant inequality, that's a good thing.
1/Since people are talking about cancel culture, I thought I might as well write a thread about it.  Some people say cancel culture doesn't exist. That's obviously wrong. Cancel culture - the practice of ostracizing people for violating cultural norms - has always existed.

The impeachment process is long and arduous, but cancel culture is immediate.  Since Trump came from showbiz the legislative body should put him in quick turnaround so he can go be president somewhere else.
You can criticize cancel culture, SJW, PC etc. etc. all you want but the fact remains that a much bigger problem is that the mainstream media is constantly whitewashing bigots and normalizing bigotry.

Kanye West got a new song on his "gospel" album praising Chick-Fil-A?  I know y'all don't care about LGBTQ people or cancelling him, but don't fuck with me if you still fuck with him.   Call it cancel culture, not hearing "both sides," dismissing dissent, whatever...enough.
@RachelDavid Cancel culture.
@0XBANANA @kim_crawley Exactly. You can’t find a line, where he is exiled, but gets to eat, sleep, live, somewhere else.  All those things require a job.  Cancel culture is livid that people “bounce back”.  Dead people don’t bounce back. It’s there. It’s right there. Make them die.
@sbtge @serraabak You are right that nobody is *leading* cancel culture.  But I’ve seen this elsewhere. Leaderless movements are a thing. It’s scary. This is scary.  https://t.co/zdK2Te5izw

@jeffehobbs Yeah. But posting his search for housing is a threat to those who might house him, in the same way reporting on his search for employment is a threat to anyone who would give him a job.  Cancel culture is livid about people “bouncing back”.  Dead people do not bounce back.

Let me explain why I play clips of liberals like Bill Maher. There are huge defections on the left over things like political correctness, cancel culture, media silence on Hunter Biden, and yes, impeachment. But the media ignores to spin a narrative that the left is in lockstep.
@wrblplayas @iRyan “Cancel culture”  Oh, you mean consequences. Damn them all!
@KyleTims @Dan_Selcke I think there's a good argument that cancel culture doesn't actually exist, or at least, not as reactionaries frame it. Obviously anyone can keep doing and saying what they want. But people who are offended also get to say if they're offended.  https://t.co/6ejse7iiMH
@KyleTims @Dan_Selcke I don't think comedies about dick and fart jokes are off-limits. I don't think dramas about incest and murder are off-limits, either. Actually, for all the cries of "cancel culture," I think most stuff is still very much in bounds.
Comedy has always operated entirely on "cancel culture" — if you suck, you don’t get booked. Now, the definition of “suck” has been expanded a bit, and the people who now suck are pissed off.
LIFE ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED. I hung out with Margaret Cho! I had *JUST* gotten off a plane so bear with my breathlessness! I TELL HER TO HER FACE THAT SHE IS A TREASURE. We talked about Amy Tan, ZINES, cancel culture and our mixed feelings about Constance Wu's bangs in Hustlers.

@nJJJJRh @wesyang @KevinWGlass Aw. Thanks.  Yes, for context (even though it's technically not necessary to my point), there are lots of examples of "cancel culture" that outrage me.   But it's a spectrum. Some cases of a person getting fired for public statements seem fine to me, others seem very unfair...
Bill Maher Blasts Cancel Culture: ‘P.C.

@wesyang @KevinWGlass And anyways, it IS germane to your point; your point is (roughly) that cancel culture is widespread and bad. And the misrepresentation makes this example look like stronger evidence for your point than it really is.
@maradydd Fort Fuck Cancel Culture
@rduran @JimVejvoda Ironically, the only film that was actually canceled because people were offended was THE HUNT, and it was canceled by the conservatives groups who are also complaining about "cancel culture."
@thomdunn Cancel culture has gone after kids like the Covington teens to try to destroy their lives. It goes after random private citizens on a regular basis to get them fired, kicked out of colleges, etc but never people like this. I’m not advocating for it but it’s clear why this happens

@aredridel @zedshaw @craiger Again: this is why they are called mental health *problems*. The people have not been able to solve the problems themselves.

People worry about “cancel culture” but everyone who’s been “cancelled” has made a come back except those in prison or who died before they could, and Kevin Spacey.  So so long as you’re not gay or a woman, you should be fine, if not better after being cancelled.

@BryanHart_ @panther_modern Nothing fatal. If you want incarceration, you’re going to have to charge him.  My concern is less in RMS and more in the awkward ways cancel culture is demanding suicide.

“Cancel culture” as a thing maybe describes a large online group of people with incomplete information attempting to get someone fired or incite them to self-harm (or others to harm them). A predator being exposed is merely delayed consequences.
Dan engages often in what I would describe as willful blindness. His terminology (cancel culture warriors) minimizes the lived experience and documented examples in favor of pointing out people make fun of Stallman’s hygiene and requirements as a speaker.

@JackiSchechner Among other reasons, Maher is peeved about Me Too and cancel culture so he's lashing out at the left quite a bit. He thinks he's entitled to say whatever he wants, while the people who listen/watch him are not. Free speech should be cherished -- for *everyone* -- not just celebs.
@ReneeStephen @no_scooters If nobody thinks this terrible thing but a few trolls, I am wrong and I am happy to be corrected by you.  If some do think this terrible thing, I am right but I am joined by someone who obviously has no problem with cancel culture in general. I’m happy for the consensus.
@ReneeStephen @no_scooters Look, a whole bunch of people have replied to “death is not ok” with “well abusing women is not ok” and it’s like both can be true, people. Death is still not ok.  You wanna say this isn’t cancel culture, I’m ok with that.
@ReneeStephen @no_scooters Let’s agree, then. Cancel culture is not an excuse to wish death (or death causing conditions like homelessness) on others. These are different things, or at least must be.

I need cancel culture to cancel Monday.
@dakami @hikikomorphism Also, a handful of people’s finally-released anger isn’t cancel culture. Also cancel culture isn’t a thing. In our earlier days, it used to be called “consequences”.
@matthaig1 Right, he isn’t cancelled. Cancel culture doesn’t exist. People will say things about personal decisions. It isn’t a new culture &amp; no one is cancelled. We have Trump as president, ffs. Bill Maher still has his show. Dave Chappelle made millions. I see absolutely no cancel culture

@ralph_squillace Acknowledging publicly what many are afraid to say. “Am I next?” is the morbid fear surrounding all cancel culture. “I didn’t think they’d demand he die on the streets...”  People are scared.  People project. Even smart people. Even kids. Especially kids.  Bad things happen.
@matthaig1 If anything, i think the people eager to denounce cancel culture like to pretend it’s a problem so they can keep from extending their empathy to marginalized folks who will take the time to say something is messed up.
@matthaig1 I keep seeing people using “cancel culture” to paint a broad brush to denounce people making personal decisions and have no power. And the powerful people who cry “cancel culture” try to gaslight folks, calling them “mobs” and irrational instead of looking at individual cases
@matthaig1 I don’t know any person who has only been canceled. Just people who did or shit shitty things and numerous people said it’s offensive. If anything the people who denounce cancel culture are not tolerant about people having opinions about others’ behavior
@matthaig1 So you think cancel culture exists because you believe in Dunbar’s number? I’m not sure I follow.

I would like to say cancel culture does not have a “Why hasn’t this person killed himself yet” problem, but it does.  Many people are rightfully hated for misdeeds in their past, and there might well be legitimate consequences on the table.  Generally not death.  Slow your roll.
@venetianblonde But there are lots of people wanting things to be cancelled and cancelling them as individuals. Maybe that is cancel culture?
@JayThePuppet Yes, get it. Maybe cancel culture is just the desire for people to be cancelled and frustration when they aren’t.
Wow the world is strongly divided between people who believe cancel culture is a thing and those who say it absolutely isn’t. This is another modern problem. We all live in separate realities.

@TonySakich …but there’s nothing there.  He says he doesn’t know what the complaints were about.  He says he’s never heard of the concept of "cancel culture."  His example of how it affected him makes no sense.  How is it NOT vague nonsense?
“The critics of cancel culture are plainly threatened not by a new and uniquely powerful kind of public criticism but by a new set of critics: young progressives, including many minorities and women who, largely through social media, have obtained a seat at the table...”  Yes.
"Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States" should have been the end of him as a public figure and the fact that it wasn't proves cancel culture isn't real.

@Paul_Sacca @Dualityman81 “Cancel culture” also known as not giving them your money, believe it or not, has existed for as long as money has been around.
The most notable thing about cancel culture is that nobody pleads for mercy or forgiveness. All the appeals are to a utilitarian logic of surrendering hostilities for peace.

@Elizrael @JennyCafarella @TheStudyofWar @leloveluck Alright then it's worth asking whether that avoidance actually means they oppose releasing blameless innocents, or just didn't focus on that question.  Otherwise this is cancel culture 😄
@ipointthethumb @DMRegister @Outkick I mean, that’s how capitalism works. If you offer a product the market doesn’t want then your company ceases to exist. Cancel culture didn’t end the horse and buggy industry, cars did.
@ScooterMcWagon Are you really this dumb? Cancel culture would be saying Schiano shouldn’t be able to have any coaching job. Not supporting him for a particular job is not remotely the same thing at all.
Many are confused by the concept of cancel culture. Easy example. Saying, “I don’t like something,” &amp; choosing not to support it is how capitalistic democracies work. That’s great. Saying, “I don’t like something and no one should be able to support it,” is cancel culture.
@ipointthethumb @DMRegister @Outkick There’s a big difference between saying, “I’m not going,” and saying “I’m not going and no one else should be able to go either.” The latter is cancel culture the former isn’t.

Firing this reporter wasn't the right move any more than exposing King's old tweets was the right move.   Both foster cancel culture, and that's exactly the thing we need to be backing away from.
@tomgara I’m ambivalent about his firing, fwiw, because I despise cancel culture. It’s the hypocrisy. It’s like when a fundie pastor is outed as gay, or a MADD mom gets a DUI.

@CathyYoung63 Here's your chance to strike a powerful blow against cancel culture!
@pegobry I’m not really sure how someone getting fired for doing something jerky is “cancel culture.”
This is how tone deaf the media is... -People complain about cancel culture and people being punished for stupid things they said years prior -As an example, people show that even the paper's staff has done stupid things -Paper responds by firing said staff member
This is a fascinating study of a cancel culture bomb blowing up in the face of a newspaper. (And, uh, why aren’t the editors at equal fault here?)
A guy tried to cancel on me, but I assumed he was using the “cancel culture” definition of “cancel” in which nothing actually happens, so I went to date anyway
Whenever “cancel culture” comes up I think about how Ida Wells paper, the Free Speech, was burned down and its owner run out of town on threat of death because she said most of the “rapes” lynchings were premised on were consensual relationships between black men and white women
@BradOnMessage I think cancel culture and socially responsible investing are two completely different movements. Warren is in the latter but probably not the former, which is not automatic for all Ds.
As poetically just as it is that Aaron Calvin was cancelled. The point isn’t to expand cancel culture but to stop this bullshit. No one’s slate is clean. No one is pure. No one escapes the moronically immature teen years as a paragon of virtue.
@gl0baln0l3 @LBoogie213 @okayplayer Cancel culture doesn't work on just being offended. It's about using people's oppression as comedic relief.

No one changes anything going into this thinking they can out-cancel cancel culture. No one will ever learn any lessons if people won’t give others a chance to redeem themselves. Only way this stops. Goodnight.
I don’t even like this guy and now the Register has me defending him for the sole reason that they found it a more expedient PR move to continue the cancel culture and scapegoat him for the decisions the editors admitted they made. No one learned a single thing.
Oh! Oh! How about cancel culture as a symbol of white supremacy?
You had a real opportunity @DMRegister to make a statement about this cancel-culture environment and honestly, it feels like you simply hung the reporter out to dry for editorial decisions your higher ups admitted they made in a previous statement.

@ijbailey I mean, look, I agree some "cancel culture" complaints are overblown (like the Joker movie criticism). But this really seems like a classic case of (1) people being punished for wrongthink and (2) ensuring that the speakers' bureau is not open to  wrongthink.

@ijbailey Yeah, OK -- "cancel culture" is the wrong term here. How about "authoritarian censorship culture"?
I hate #CancelCulture. And I still love the @nytimes, not just as a former emp, but bc of the many great journalists doing good work. But I also believe that to change media we have to demand better, and sometimes that means with your wallet, not just your tweets.
Hundreds?  Try millions. And counting. As an Iowan - I’m humiliated by this. Iowa is full of good-hearted people who care for each other. This cancel-culture cancer does not belong. The Register owes an unconditional apology to King &amp; the sick children at the Children’s hospital.
Everyone is very candid on here and there in no way has been a flight to private encrypted chats, vetted message boards and listservs, because cancel culture is definitely not real and if it were real it would be good.

the issue for me is that when someone says "cancel culture doesn't exist" its basically never accompanied with this conversation; like no, a culture built around cancelling is absolutely pretend - we agree  but also capitalism exists

I think calling it cancel culture rather than "capitalist norms" helps shift the blame away from the overall social narrative and towards people who are "creating bad culture that hurts people."
But it's apparent everywhere, and that's not "cancel culture." It's just the obvious fact that socializing people with hypercompetitive norms suck.
I have to say I disagree with people who just outright dismiss "cancel culture." I don't believe it's some new phenomenon that we should pretend it's its own culture (and give it's own name), that it is in fact a manifestation of competitive capitalist norms in social life.

@CarsonKing2 made a mistake as a 16 year-old. As a 24 year-old he’s helped raise a $1 million for a children’s hospital.  Busch and Des Moines Register are major companies, and they’re afraid of the “woke scolds.”  #CancelCulture is evil. Watch and share!   https://t.co/N9IJ3IAgZY

@SXMProgress If this is what "cancel culture" looks like, getting a victim-blaming fluff piece in a major magazine and then your own radio show, sign me up. I'm ready to be cancelled. But of course, that's only ever granted to white men so JK guess I'll just keep trying not to be an asshole.
Our country is definitely being destroyed from within. Who would’ve ever thought communists would use SJW’s and cancel culture to take down the United States. It’s gross.

Cancel culture is garbage conduct by garbage people. The Des Moines Register chose to participate in that culture.
What some people call cancel culture, others call consequences. None of you are free of sin. Everyone will be punished.
@senatorshoshana So when you say “cancel culture,” what are you referring to? Is it something more consequential than...just people publicly critiquing/engaging with public speech?   Can you give an example of a canceling?
This will be the result of cancel culture  https://t.co/UHS38uAGhy
@jaycaspiankang Hmm one difference I notice is that reactionaries use denouncing “Cancel culture” or clapping back at it as a marketing tool. Like, “support me to pwn the libs!’  Or to hide that sometimes there’s a consensus of people saying something is wrong by calling it a mob¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@DMRegister We hope this backfires on you in such a tremendous way that your newspaper folds. Media outlets around the country are ripping you today. Hope your “Cancel Culture/woke” bullcrap was worth your reputation and possibly some of your reporters careers. Hope it was worth it
@jaycaspiankang Cancel culture isn't a real thing, though. People have been silenced since before manipulative rich people made it into a term.

The people throwing around the phrase “cancel culture” seem to imply that we have to accept everything anyone says or does as hunky dory and never disagree or critique and you know what? I’m canceling that way of thinking because nope.
@heckyessica @DLoesch Saying the whole publication needs to close bc of a shitty reporter and editor is literally the cancel culture you’re going off about.
Do you think that our republic should embrace this sick cancel culture where people are being destroyed for tweets they’ve sent when teenagers or ridiculous PC culture?

This guy was sent thousands of dollars after making a Game Day sign asking for beer money. Rather than keep it, he decided to use it to raise even MORE money to donate to a children's hospital. And now he's in hot water for a tweet he wrote at 16.   Cancel culture is a DISEASE.

@OsitaNwanevu I mean the problem is I have no idea exactly what you're talking about or to what you're referring. I don't know what you mean by "cancel culture," because it's an increasingly dumpster-fire term. The biggest problem with your piece is you attempt NO engagement with what has
To those still acting like "cancel culture" is really making a huge dent in trashbag's lives: Kanye West is now the highest paid rapper this year, making $150 million since June 2018 according to Forbes.  $150 million AFTER backing Trump.

@_Almaqah I don't know what "cancel culture" means and have only used it in a broad sense, responding to other people's arguments about what it is and isn't. I think it is a borderline useless term at this point.

@OsitaNwanevu It can't honestly be that you don't understand there's a difference between writing "Kat wrote that several authors had been targeted by cancel culture" and "Kat wrote that several authors had been casualties of cancel culture"... Right?
@OsitaNwanevu @katrosenfield @JeffreyASachs Osita, with respect -- this bad-faith bullshit that works very well on Twitter and in TNR, where there is no one to call you on it, is not going to work with me, ever. I am asking you to defend your claim that Kat said a number of authors were "casualties" of cancel culture.
@OsitaNwanevu @katrosenfield @JeffreyASachs I can't tell if I'm being trolled here. Do you recognize that these two phrases are different  -"target of an attempted cancallation" -"cancel-culture casualty"?  It is weird to me I have to do this with a professional staff writer at TNR.
@OsitaNwanevu @katrosenfield @JeffreyASachs Do you understand that you took a graf in which she noted some ongoing controversies, and then quickly proceeded to say they had FAILED to gain much pickup, and presented that list as "casualties" of cancel culture?
Addendum: Cancel culture only exists in regards to politicians
@HayleyMundeva But context matters, too. And in 2019 this kind of argument is often used to shut down valid criticsm and accountability. It is not the same as, but rhymes with, the people who call any kind of consequences "cancel culture."
Could cancel culture please catch up to this guy already?
@JeffreyASachs But aren't people who use the term "cancel culture" necessarily describing a phenomenon that won't have the same affect on everyone? Whether one ends up like Justine Sacco or someone  who is criticized but doesn't go viral often seems arbitrary in a way that affects chillingness

@_Almaqah This is what I think of as being ‘cancel culture’  https://t.co/FkwyD4ciyx
@_Almaqah You’d have to ask the writer—my opinion is that the Sarah Silverman thing is, but Jay Z isn’t. “Canceling” is just shorthand, but “cancel culture” as I understand it is the *culture itself* of looking for past transgressions.
@_Almaqah Yes, Nick Clairmont’s language column this week does a good job, it’s out from behind the paywall at midnight. To my mind, what makes Gibson not cancel culture is that it wasn’t past comments subjected to current standards. But also I don’t think Gibson should be canceled.
@ZaidJilani It’s also the complete unwillingness to actually engage with ppl’s arguments. The ‘cancel culture’ debate is an interesting one! I’m open to arguments it’s not such a thing. But all I’m seeing is strawman attacks and handwaving.
Cancel culture is out of control! Now these people want a former Governor to not give credibility to a guy who called Obama a Muslim who should be hung for treason...actually, that seems pretty reasonable
Osita Nwanevu either didn't read Kat's article closely, or is simply lying about it. There is no way to read the grafs in question and suggest that she was listing "other supposed casualties of cancel culture."  Can't stand this bad-faith stuff. It's everywhere.
Comedian: Marginalized groups are dumb and bad.  Marginalized Groups: You're dumb and bad.  Comedian: [writes a thinkpiece for the NYT about the collapse of civility] [does a press tour about Cancel Culture] [names his next Netflix special "Triggered"]
And the graf Nwanevu quotes was, in fact, a list of controversies that DID NOT catch on, illustrating the arbitrary nature of this stuff; presenting it as a "list" of "supposed casualties of cancel culture" is either a massive reading comprehension fail or an intentional lie

@GodlessEngineer I'm still left. I have not changed. Feminism Has. Cancel Culture can kiss my ass. I will do all the shows.  Make all the statements everywhere. I cant be bothered with this petty shit.
Cancel culture is a tulpa -- it doesn't exist but if enough people believe in it, it will exist.
All of this. It cannot be overstated how much of the hand-wringing over “cancel culture” is really a backlash by a Rightwing celebrity class against those they have traditionally worked desperately to not hear.  https://t.co/opurhLVyRM
@elbandito2016 Not my def. I'm still left. Pro choice pro autonomy pro LGBT pro socas. Pro humanism pro kindness pro science pro skepticism.  Anti cancel culture. Pro due process. Anti purity test. Anti tribalism.
@vadimnewquist Or maybe ill throw them off my train. Like Im doing to the reg left now.  Cancel Culture sucks. Purity tests are childish. Civil rights aren't disposable and social justice is not a weapon. Civil discourse beats name calling and labeling, and forgiveness is not a sin.

I liked this article a lot. I am so sick of seeing news outlets talk about cancel culture like the latest epidemic when only a handful of people ever face any consequences at all for their harmful actions. It's just the same generational conflict that has always existed.

@HamptonStevens @Rainovertrees I was responding to a tweet claiming that those complaining about "PC" and "cancel culture" are just objecting to civility and being criticized out loud.  Which is definitely neither insightful nor original.
Ahh, the regressives who shit on me without evidence now are complaining I'm not 100% on line with them anymore.  To be clear, I dont care. I will do all the shows I want and it will not make me more or less guilty.Your petty feuds are not my concern,nor is your cancel culture.

2/ they don't actually want to talk about any of this -- meaning "cancel culture" or online mobs or whatever -- they are focusing on the infinitesimally small subset of cases where no sane person would feel THAT much sympathy, because the target is insanely rich and famous.
@jessesingal The main problem with his piece is he thinks the big criticism of cancel culture is that it destroys the lives of rich comedians. Nobody but rich comedians cares about what happens to rich comedians. It's what the phenomenon does to the broader popular culture that's dangerous.
1/ I'm inevitably going to do an article or newsletter post about this latest skirmish in the Cancel Culture Wars, but just to get one point out there right away: because of the definitional fuzziness of "cancel culture," a thick fog of bullshit has descending on this entire
@JohnDiesattheEn I mean we may disagree on stuff but this is the point I have been making forever. I don't understand how you can pretend this stuff isn't a big deal when cases like this arise: cancel-culture skeptics never address this part   https://t.co/HAhNe2dSch
But when criticizing the panic over "cancel culture" it's very dangerous to do what this author did, which was boil it down to, "If you have not been physically assaulted or jailed, then you have nothing to complain about when it comes to backlash." If that was true ...
this is why there’s so much outrage over so called cancel culture. There’s great inequity and inconsistency
dave chappelle is funny. so are bill burr, adam carolla, sebastian maniscalco, sarah silverman, and other comedians who have been dragged for their jokes and  spoken out about cancel culture.  they're not condemned witches or on a hollywood blacklist. the comparison is asinine.
to make that comparison you'd be drawing a line between prominent comedians and a social class that had been oppressing the powerless. more importantly, you'd have to know they happened. most people don't because, like cancel culture vs. comedians, they had little lasting impact.
if you want to compare cancel culture to historical phenomena, the most appropriate ones i can think of are the jacquerie or the revolution of 1525: peasants who, after being treated like shit for several centuries, formed angry mobs to inflict misery on the aristocracy.
about a year ago, when people were complaining that cancel culture was like the reign of terror, they found much less sympathy.  after all, such a comparison places prominent celebrities alongside asshole french aristocrats who had been grinding their peasantry into the dust.
since i studied witch-hunting in college and my senior thesis was on similarities between witch-hunting and mccarthyism, it's annoying to see powerful, successful comedians (specifically) compare *~ cAnCeL cUlTuRe ~* to either or both of them.
This is an honest and exceptionally written piece about when personal pain and news story collide, the strange monolith that is cancel culture and why the internet age does not allow writers to be fallible
it's political correctness when you get mad and cancel culture when I get mad, I don't see what's hard about this
As the baby cried his heart out this morning I thought “Don’t be so sad baby. At least there’s no way for Aaron Sorkin to make a new episode of TV about cancel culture”
@jaycaspiankang Most discussions of say cancel culture involve its effects on rich, powerful, and/or famous types. There's a logical asymmetry there you're right to identify but I don't think it's right to put rando user no. 242 and a guy with a Netflix contract on the same rhetorical level.
is mislabeling your receipts cancel culture
@JeffreyASachs @OsitaNwanevu Indeed. Every time someone complained of cancel culture, I just wanted to ask, who has been cancelled? My next question was, if this is what getting cancelled is like, how do I get cancelled?
@katrosenfield I didn't think it was unfair or misrepresented your piece, actually. Your essay was about toxic fandom, his is about material consequences "cancel culture," which get exaggerated for fun and profit. It's neither your fault nor his that opportunists read your article in bad faith.

my favorite instance of Osita doing Cancel Culture was the Drunk TED Talk where he read extensively from an old George Will column blaming the decline of western civilization on jeans
The fact that many of the anti-cancel culture writers cited are friends and are all some flavor of trans-antagonistic make the last few paragraphs especially powerful.
I am just appalled that the New Republic published a repudiation of “cancel culture” and failed to mention the concentration camps on the southern border OR the Syrian refugee crisis. Truly heartless work over there.

I get that the photos are new for a lot of people and they need to emotionally process them. I'll be glad when they're not splashed on every media outlet. But they're also from a very different time in Trudeau's life. You can't condemn cancel culture, then perpetuate it.
@lukalaik Dicho eso, también al "otro lado", hay quien confunde cualquier crítica o intento de discusión o análisis con censura o "cancel culture". La verdad que resulta fascinante cómo herramientas supuestamente diseñadas para "conectarnos" han hecho que discutir sea tan difícil.
All cultures cancel certain opinions, says @DamonLinker. What "cancel culture" does is different.  https://t.co/FpXws6fxdX
Trudeau hid his #BlackfaceTrudeau  habit cuz he was "embarrassed." If any other mortal was so presumptuous he'd string them up. Same rules for him. HIS rules. High sanctimony and zero tolerance for any deviation from #woke diktats is high treason in his #CancelCulture. #cdnpoli

@KimWood42252122 @Independent He has been a champion of cancel culture and brutally harsh w anyone who transgresses the impossible standards he sets. Now he has to live up to his own standards. If he wasn’t cute and a trudeau he would never have gotten this far. He forgot that he too is mortal.
Trudeau has been an outspoken leader &amp; champion of #CancelCulture. He has held himself out as being a flawless paragon of virtue. Zero understanding when others trip up. Now he’s feeling what he has inflicted on so many. What he SHOULD do is own THAT. #TrudeauBlackface #cdnpoli
I'm tired of cancel culture, of outrage, of tribalism and of the constant politicisation of everything. I'm tired of the binary way in which people see the world, black and white, left and right, right and wrong. This way of doing things is neither pleasant nor productive.
forget cancel culture - reboot culture. Can’t we just make new things? Gah. Like rebooting Battlestar?  Or Princess Bride? Blarg.

@lunster81 @Imamofpeace He has practiced cancel culture. Viciously. Touche time
@AHHHHHHHCHOO @Imamofpeace He would hang anyone else who did this. He is a champion of cancel culture. No ifs ands or buts. Same obnoxious standard should apply to him
@TheRealUgom @Imamofpeace He would hang anyone else because he is a cancel culture champion. That’s what this is about and that’s what I wrote.
@lunster81 @Imamofpeace The main point? Which I actually address. Is that Trudeau is a champion of cancel culture. A practitioner and advocate. Except when it comes to him. Hoisted on his own petard.
@washingtonpost Only time God is brought up in the WP opinion page is to justify “cancel culture?” Very telling

@Izbiski_Gaming We're on very similar pages, though I don't like to see ANYONE fall to cancel culture precisely because I fundamentally disagree with cancel culture.
@clairlemon @randomized43278 It's a tough call. Agree that it smacks of "cancel culture," but in this case the author's politics strongly contradict what the prize is about.
People who bitch about cancel-culture are now heavily participating in cancel-culture. That’s no way to cancel cancel culture.
@quinnnorton But these are two different sites for the argument. To take the rms case, no one is arguing against emacs or gcc -- the cancel culture that formed around R. Kelly or Michael Jackson has not formed around Stallman. So no black-and-whiting there.

Double standards in #identitypolitics aren't trivial. Many are so sanguine about the destructive impact of political correctness identity rage because they never experience it. The optimist in me hopes #TrudeauBlackface will make many on the left aware of #cancelculture's cruelty
@nyunggai I don't know. Going after people's past and amplifying its significance...we should discourage. But it's important to discourage tribalism, and thus highlight that commentators who usually promote #cancelculture can't award exceptions to rage politics when it's one of their own.

You're assuming consistency of principle is important to those on social media, when really most of us vary our principles on cancel culture, outrage etc based on tribalism ie if it's one of us or them copping it.
@sethdmichaels @mehdirhasan cancel culture has really overpromised
turns out the trending Jim Jones is not the cult leader. i thought maybe the dreaded cancel culture had finally caught up with him too.
Blackface me once shame on you, blackface me twice shame on me. Blackface me THREE times? Mama that's cancel culture
@9th_Amendment Not sure how you would apply the concept of "cancel culture" to a federal election.  He isn't a comedian on SNL, where some random thing got dug up from decades ago.   Also I reserve the right to make fun of Trudeau for being a naif.

@JustinTrudeau handled it well, so far. Thnk U. 🙏🏾 There’s no roadmap for coming back from racism. But, I have little appetite for call-out &amp; cancel culture. That’s not social justice &amp; I’ve seen what it looks like up close. Hunan beings are complex &amp; fallible.

I believe the #JustinTrudeau #blackface apology is sincere b/c he is doing the work to challenge racial injustice. Don’t compare him to the almighty. Compare him to the alternative w/ACTIVE instances of racism &amp; homophobia. #cancelculture is what gets people like Trump elected.

@EphraimGopin Cancel culture also draws near equivalence with behaviors that are wildly different. For example: I've seen Aziz Ansari's #MeToo moment equated with Harvey Weinstein's. We lose all sense of perspective.
@mattsinger @mousterpiece i suppose it was just a matter of time before gymkata cancel culture reared its ugly head
My perspective is that Trudeau did stupid things. People do stupid things. I've certainly done stupid things. Though beyond that, Trudeau has contributed monumentally to the cancel culture that would have already vaporized the career of anyone else caught doing what he did.
@ricketyoldshack @Beastin25_8 Cancel culture is a great way to at least present the idea that celebrity should be no one's goal.

"cancel culture" is just a new name for how the internet is excellent at facilitating mob mentality/groupthink, something we've all been talking about for years
"Boycott cancel culture" is a boycott I could finally get behind.
by, it is not "inconsistent" for me (and others who hate the ethos of the Cancel Culture) to go after him. You are not virtuous for taking the highfalutin "high road" and granting him a pass. I may abhor violence but if you attack me in an alley, I'll fight you. No inconsistency.
Let me type this slowly so that the slow ones could understand:  The leaders of the Cancel Culture headed by Herr Himmler of Hypocrisy @justintrudeau have imposed a set of rules on the rest of us to live by.  If their leader is now caught violating the rules that he has governed

“Cancel Culture” is lauded in bipartisan fashion when the “canceled” are people who give a damn about Palestinian human rights. Read the whole thread.
This is genuine #CancelCulture in action, folks. Anyone who dares to publicly acknowledge that Palestinians are human beings entitled to equal rights can face real personal and professional consequences. If you are an ally with power, this is where the movement could use help.
@RealTwatters @NewUnitatevires @MillionThrills @SAHRCommission Ja. Ons ruimtes krimp. #cancelculture

@caroljsroth He even earned an Oscar nomination for that performance (much deserved) so @TheAcademy would have to answer to this too. #CancelCulture must be cancelled at some point. Only then can we emerge from this new dark age.
What if: cancel culture is when someone not esp famous or powerful does something not great but the backlash is so intense and disproportionate that it winds up increasing sympathies for them?
It’s so interesting to witness the primary perpetrators of cancel culture get eaten by the beast they created.   Would hate to be you, @JustinTrudeau :(

@Geo86_Chi @agentpsyte @donlemon @ChrisCuomo @CNN The above reply is correct and I was also making the point that Lemon is not a journalist because he presents #CancelCulture as a fact, and then says how much he’s against it. It’s not a fact just like when he accepted as a fact the alt right lie that college kids are snowflakes.
@Nau4Nau @Geo86_Chi @donlemon @ChrisCuomo @CNN I RT’d Norm’s comment about me. I wasn’t aware of what he was tweeting. Lemon supports the #CancelCulture theory. My initial tweet was clear. I was slamming Lemon. I get what you’re saying though. Thanks.

@jessesingal I'm against cancel culture but I do think that both you and Trudeau should be cancelled over this.
While I think that this cancel culture of chastising someone for something they did nearly 20 years ago (that really didn’t hurt anybody) is absolutely ridiculous, do your thing left wing!  Get him!
The fact is if this was anyone on the Right it would be a massive scandal and they’d be forced to step down.   Trudeau is progressive media darling thus will get a pass.  Cancel Culture is bad enough but the asymmetry of it can’t stand much longer...   https://t.co/u0zMzRrlWH
@DerekSheen I saw #FreakishlyLargeHog was trending and at first I thought #CancelCulture had finally come for me.
When so-called “principled” people defend purveyors of cancel culture from being canceled, they’re doing so to virtue signal. They don’t care about ending the culture—they just wanna come out looking like good guys when others around them are ruined. They think they’ll be spared.

@cherryrae 'Cancel culture is bad, unless we can weaponize it' seems to be the direction. It's been a consistent theme of Canadian politics over the past four years. Self-reflection = bad.
@EnlightFundy @CathyYoung63 You linked to a story about a guy dressing in brownface and you said nothing about the racism and complained about cancel culture (despite the fact that no one is calling for Trudeau to be cancelled). There are some pretty obvious conclusions one can draw from that fact.
@EnlightFundy @CathyYoung63 Who said it's not forgivable? Trudeau himself is apologizing for it right now. But your immediate response before the apology was to post about cancel culture. Which to my mind means you are okay with this shit.
The ruling class freaks out about cancel culture or PC run amok or whatever because they all did a bunch of racist or sexist stuff and usually there are photos

Now I'm really getting interested, because the early 1990s are seen now as the heyday of political correctness, but cancel culture was clearly going strong by the mid-1980s.

I'd add others to this list including Colin Kapernick (lost job). (or Trevor Noah - kept job).  What I think this indicates is people care less about "Cancel Culture," "Freedom of Speech," etc. as concepts and more about which rules are most convenient for the moment.
(I'm using "cancel culture" in it's modern sense here, to mean "celebrity says something bigoted, suffers professional repercussions.")

@btimoney3232 Oh. Well first I’m not a leader in cancel culture, you’re putting that on me based on some idea of me you’ve created.   Second, obvi, it’s about whether you evolve or not. If you don’t you can’t claim it was only in past.   And re Louis CK he did far more than chappelle (1)
it's why I've gradually become so careful with wording as I criticize "cancel culture": I refuse to see it as a new mode. It is a new name for the ways in which capitalism keeps the working class at each other's' throats.  https://t.co/MUkMIijrP4
"this person is cancelled" is a ridiculous statement, as is "cancel culture is bad"
this is why engaging with it in a way where we say "cancel culture is good" or "cancel culture is bad" we totally miss the point.  these are norms we are encouraged to act out to divide us and see each other as enemies
by persuading us to think "cancel culture" is some horrible culture us bad plebs and our social media have created, we are again directed away from those with power, why they have power, and the mode that power exerts itself
I criticize "cancel culture" in the same way I criticize the market, because it's simply another abstract market and should be reduced to that - it is simultaneously unimportant and important  it's the intersection of the norms of capitalism and everyday life

Real cancel culture is editors telling me they wanted my book but marketing said no because it was too gay. It's the lady at the awards table saying, "Oh I've never met a transsexual!" to my bf &amp; reviewers calling my characters "promiscuous" when they couldn't say gay anymore.
@McBenefit Cancel culture was not an alt-right phrase lol. Why do you go to the extreme on everything. Breathe boo.
@Dekejlp Cancel Culture isn’t a real thing. You can’t name one person who has been permanently canceled.

@McBenefit She isn’t more republican and it’s so silly to be so dramatic about it. Go spend time in Arizona as a Dem (I have) and then judge. I understand the party’s frustration during these crucial times, but these “cancel culture” the Dems love is so stupid and pointless.

When The 'Cancel Culture' Claims One of Their Own.....  https://t.co/utWlmAoCKy via @YouTube
Whenever a guy unearths someone’s offensive tweets, it usually comes out they they at one point had inappropriate tweets as well. Cancel culture is the new ‘smelt it, dealt it.’
8/ Rather than listening and acknowledging the hurt, they double down, accuse others of not being able to take a joke, and play victim (of PC, cancel culture, etc). They show no empathy. Which again calls into question their motives in condemning cancel culture...
3/ Those upset over cancel culture tend 2b people w/ no track record of challenging bigotry or bias or doing anything related to lessening hatred or mistreatment of others in the world. Chappelle is an exception. Most are like Carolla and the douche bro culture he represents...
2/ First: most of those complaining do not, themselves, ever speak out &amp; condemn these kinds of things in less 'cancel culture' ways. It's not like the Adam Carollas of the world regularly challenge racism in responsible, less judgy ways &amp; merely disagree w/style of "SJWs"...
1/ With so many people condemning "cancel culture" and screaming about how over-sensitive folks are -- to racist humor, for instance, or other forms of bigotry, or other personal transgressions -- a few thoughts, because it seems like some important points are being ignored...

should probably just mute the phrase "cancel culture" at this point, huh
If you’re a comic (or anyone) moaning about “cancel culture” maybe consider this about the “cancelled”:  they are simply people “who can no longer pass the essential test of speaking in public, i.e., standing by your words.”
...of course, this may be why now the same thing is being referred to as "cancel culture." :-/
#Deplatforming and #CancelCulture will do to digital media what social media did to traditional.   It will force new tools and habits.   We are witnessing the birth of a new internet.   Look no further than to the current meta-backlash for tolerance in the face of old sins.
Hard to believe we can’t reach an agreement on “cancel culture” on a social media platform designed to give everyone personality disorders.

@anildash Comics shouldn't be afraid to push the limits and boundaries of what is "acceptable." It's what they have done for decades and decades.  Sometimes comics will fuck up and go too far. You can call them out, sure. But I think we disagree on what "cancel culture" ultimately wants

Regarding #CancelCulture, I'm seeing a lot of references to the idea that it's what used to be known as "consequences." Sorry, no. That's oversimplified, disingenuous and not even the half of it. To use a common phrase of this genre, "do better."

@GayNightStand @mholland1997 No boo: that’s reasonable. Cancel culture is review bombing something you didn’t buy or starting fake rumours hoping to get someone fired. Cancel culture is using the phrase “you’ve lost a potential customer”. It’s not consequences - it’s having a whine.
@smith_valence @JerrySeinfeld Is your point that "cancel culture" is racist against successful white men? Because that's hilarious if that's your take.

@smith_valence @JerrySeinfeld I did watch it. Good deal of it was pretty funny. So I don't understand this vague "you just don't get it" talk as if I'm fundamentally misunderstanding the concept of "cancel culture". Like I'm literally asking for examples of the problem he's talking about. Do you have any?
@smith_valence @JerrySeinfeld Are there any more examples of "cancel culture" besides the guy who said a bunch of racist things on a podcast that people are pretending were framed as jokes? Or is the epidemic just this one guy?
You will never see the "I just really hate cancel culture" people getting all that upset about how many women have lost their careers due to refusing to fuck the right men.
Catching up on @TheView @DaveChappelle used slurs to make a point, identify, and humanize. #ShaneGillis used them cause he's a hateful bigoted douche. Not a double standard. Calling #CancelCulture capes for #WhiteSupremacy I used. slurs 20 years ago. I learned.
@kittypurrzog Enjoyed the piece, but I think drawing on Boghossian at least partly because he is a victim of cancel culture ("banned from doing human subjects research") is problematic (thread)  https://t.co/wIoSZZ7QXK

Finally, I would like to confess to and apologize for engaging in cancel culture, when I told my research assistant she was banned(!) from engaging in research until she did human subjects training. 9/  https://t.co/eAA1p0cwgN
Another lesson is that if cancel culture is everything, maybe its nothing. If journalists frame any type of punishment or imposition of social norms as cancel culture, then the term loses all descriptive value. 8/
...e.g., "I'm not pro-racist jokes, I'm just pro-free speech and/or anti-"cancel culture"/"PC"/"call outs". I talk about this in super-in-depth in this piece:  https://t.co/pP83Yf0f72
The lesson here is that "cancel culture" as a trope is easily weaponized, allowing those who receive a slap on the wrist for obvious failures to cast themselves as victims of oppression rather than defend their actual actions. 7/  https://t.co/fyC4XFPwgX
...but this does highlight how complaining about "cancel culture" or "political correctness" or whatever is often a way of taking a side in specific debates (e.g., racist comedian dude) while simultaneously projecting an air of neutrality...

Can everyone just agree that cancel culture is fine long enough to cancel this?
When I teach students about organizational culture, I note what I call the "______ culture" problem. Thats the idea is that you name something you don't like, and then append "culture" to it.  And I think we are at that point with "cancel culture." 1/

Just so I'm caught up on the new vernacular, "cancel culture" is "consequences for being a turd"?

the only "cancel culture" is the one that robbed the world of HANNIBAL s4
Lost in the whole @Shanemgillis thing is how much @nbcsnl has blown for the better part of two decades.   @kirkmin talked today about the PC mob and cancel culture.  Get it now:  https://t.co/UK9I6ywFCF  https://t.co/aNeHf9a1O5
@marknutter @CantHardyWait @paulg 2/ broadly, it's because the left's "cancel culture" was kind of a response to a specific dynamic of, for example, some rapists or racists operating with relative impunity for decades. Parallel to how civil rights marches were a "left" phenomena as a response to discrimination.
New SNL recruit's firing criticised as 'cancel culture' by Bill Burr and Jim Jeffries  https://t.co/LcrG0pqXJI
If cancel culture was a real thing we wouldn’t be subjected to this fucking horseshit.  https://t.co/hlluvETkv7
We basically compiled all the best comics in the world and asked their takes on #CancelCulture. There’s a lot more in our movie, but if you really want to spectrum of opinions from people you respect, our film Tasteless is a good place to start!  https://t.co/GVnaUqAvkQ
Over the last several years, I have dropped several subscriptions to magazines I realized I almost never read.   *This is cancel culture run amuck.*
@elizaskinner Cancel culture taking my guns!
@FisayoAkinade I think more recently she’s complaining about “cancel culture” but I blocked her form when she was trying to justify doing blackface.
lol @ painting “cancel culture” as the social evil to be concerned about, and not casual racism and bigotry
Weird how critics of "cancel culture" don't talk about the contemporary celebrity who has suffered the greatest professional consequences for his views — Colin Kaepernick
THIS! @BillBurr and Jim Jefferies w David Spade on Cancel Culture: "Did they go back and also try to look at the good things?...Help a cat out of a tree...that's not it!"  Watch:  https://t.co/70hidKxh9N
@EoinHiggins_ @JonathanCohn Looks like cancel culture’s a’comin for our boy Jonathon
And yes, she doesn't stand by that stuff anymore! It's almost like "cancel culture" is...people holding you accountable.
imagine thinking cancel culture has gone too far when the fossil fuel industry still exists
There should be a “Tax Return Principle” in private life. That is, in an era of smears, deep fakes, screenshots, hackers, bot farms, cancel culture, photoshop, etc... my/your public allegation about your/my *private* life does not entitle me/you to your/my privacy to contest it.
There’s something to be said about the folks who pipe up complaining about what they deem ‘cancel culture’ ... Silverman, Chapelle, etc... *squints*
Cancel culture is vicious and ugly. You won’t catch me demonising someone I don’t know and simplifying a complex human being down to a single action. Step up your empathy game folks. When someone does something you disagree with it doesn’t strip them of their humanity.
chilling suppression of free speech imo, cancel culture goes too far
The only people who rail against "cancel culture" are people who others have tried to cancel.
re: rob schneider and shane gillis:  when people use the term “cancel culture”- that is what you call GASLIGHTING.   acting like all the sudden people are “overly” sensitive because you said some wildly racist and homophobic shit is gaslighting.
It’s so easy to forget how long cancel culture has been with us.   Remember Firefly? Remember Deadwood? Remember the original Star Trek?   This is not new.
@RobSchneider @Shanemgillis Believe it or not, it IS possible to be FUNNY without calling Chinese ppl the derogatory “C” word! Nice try, Rob. This isn’t a fight about censorship or the “cancel culture”. It’s a fight against racism. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Just admit it - Shane is NOT funny.
Let's "cancel culture" all medical debt am I right
Cancel culture is not new. Anyone read The Scarlet Letter?  What’s new is it’s now being used to punch up rather than down.
Once again: "Cancel culture" is really the result of clickbait headlines that maximize the bottom line by stoking rage. If you're crying "cancel culture," you're just helping line the pockets of the already very wealthy who are using your discomfort to make a profit.
@richterscale @1gillianfrank1 Cancel culture etc etc
surprise! this is a joke for comedy, now if you disagree with me you are part of cancel culture
I don’t understand the bemoaning of cancel culture as if it is entirely new— like the Dixie Chicks saga never happened.
Y'all say comedy is dead, but seeing people have a meltdown over a non-existent phenomenon known as "cancel culture" is genuinely amusing to me.   "Era of cultural unforgiveness" LOL huh? Did comedians have similar meltdown when it became unpopular to wear blackface [publicly]?
So, this is all to say, his firing isn’t “cancel culture”, it isn’t a “culture of unforgiveness”. If he wasn’t proud of what he’d done, I believe there was an avenue for forgiveness. He chose not to take it.
all these efforts to cancel shane gillis' critics show cancel culture has gone too far
I remember seeing Cancel Culture open for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah in 2005, and they were just okay.
When the women of *the view* are uncomfortable w Shane Gillis' firing, maybe we've jumped the shark on cancel culture.
@Trevornoah McCain said the jokes were offensive bc they weren't funny; Chappelle's jokes were funny, she said. McCain also said she doesn't like "cancel culture" and there could have been a teachable moment by having discussion on the issue instead of firing Gillis.
I was canceled before cancel culture was cool.
why are washed comedians obsessed with a cancel culture that doesn’t exist?
Bill Burr and Jim Jefferies defend Shane Gillis, attack "cancel culture" on @LightsOut   https://t.co/OPjHy2DGAt
"the cancel culture"
also jfc she’s a perfect example of “cancel culture” not actually having the consequences people think it does. she had her own controversy, and now she’s in the LA times as the voice of comedy
didn’t SS do blackface in the past? people this concerned with “cancel culture” are almost always telling on themselves. do you really think comedy is going to die, or do you just not want to be held accountable for the bad shit you’ve said and don’t want to stop saying?
*Samara voice* 7  D A Y S  until you can read my new book, “Obviously: Stories from my Timeline” and also—in 2019 if someone called your cell from a number you didn’t know you probably wouldn’t pick up so how will Samara live? Cancel culture/Scam Likely is ruining lives 😂  https://t.co/cIAHBQ6dgC
Here’s my 2 cents on, “Cancel Culture” - if you raped or sexually assaulted someone, your ENTIRE LIFE should be cancelled. YOU SHOULD NO LONGER EXIST. If you said something derogatory, once, let’s uphold our freedoms &amp; not destroy the person. Actions are still louder, joke or no.
Today's Show is LIVE: @Shanemgillis is fired and @FeitsBarstool doesn't care about PC cancel culture  Get it:  https://t.co/UK9I6yf4e5 @kirkmin @BigSteve207 @BlindMike_
@Dnellicious Also, this world has become so blindly divisive that people will support him simply because they are "anti-cancel culture", regardless of if they actually enjoy that person's comedy or not. I wouldn't be surprised to see him lean really hard into racist jokes at this point.
Bill Burr, David Spade, And Jim Jefferies Perfectly Sum Up Everything That's Going On With 'Cancel Culture' And The SNL Firing  https://t.co/Q0y8Ht5tKP
@whitneydawn What is the collective? When and where do they deliberate? I often hear people use that and similar terms to decry “cancel culture,” but I make decisions to stop engaging certain people at will and I don’t rely on a hive mind to do it. I’m certainly not the only one doing that.
‘Cancel culture’ is incredibly nuanced, rooted in hurt and suffering, and very complicated. So obviously the best place to have this conversation is Twitter.
New Podcast! The New York Times LIES about Kavanaugh and SNL caves to the woke #CancelCulture mob, which sets bad precedent for the comedy profession.  Please like, share and subscribe!  https://t.co/hIzomacZdW
@latimesent So we've officially replaced "consequences" with the term "cancel culture"? I guess we need to let @MerriamWebster know?
call me when "cancel culture" gets on the Sedition Act of 1798's level
it seems like the people who obsess over "cancel culture" have now broadened the definition to basically just refer to any and all criticism of famous people? very cool
There is no "cancel culture." If I don't like something, I do will not patronize that thing. If enough people don't like a thing, they won't patronize that thing. Is that "canceling" or just a collection of personal choices?
My grandfather was jailed by McCarthy and let me tell you he would have killed for some “cancel culture.”
@cjciaramella cancel culture, out of control
@pegobry @BenjySarlin @jbarro So “guy said something bananas racist and didn’t get a job because of the bananas racist thing” isn’t cancel culture, under this rubric?
The outrage over "cancel culture" is misdirected. All cultures "cancel" things, rule things morally out of bounds, etc. What gets people agitated by contemporary cancelation is that it's being done in the name of moral standards associated with the left-wing activists.
@megh_wright I just spent the last hour arguing with people who don’t get that @donlemon saying he’s sick of #CancelCulture like it’s a journalistic fact is garbage. I’m tired too.  Sometimes twitter is just a cesspool.
@pegobry Because I don’t know if writing an extravagantly racist article gets one fired now when everyone’s yelling about “cancel culture” and “political correctness.”
@BenjySarlin @OsitaNwanevu @RyanJSuto @smsaideman as @MattBruenig pointed out on another thread, one of the only actual cancellations of big celebrities was way back before anyone talked about "cancel culture": the dixie chicks
Wanted to share my appearance last night on @CNNTonight with @donlemon talking our “cancel culture.” Yes, some people deserve to be fired but Knee jerk firing isn’t always the right answer. We need a more nuanced approach so that we can encourage people to evolve for the better:
@cjane87 @pegobry Yeah I think outrage over the broad idea of cancel culture has become a way to disregard the specific facts and circumstances that drive a complaint (see exhibit A, Donald Trump)
We're talking about the #SNL firing of #ShaneGillis this morning on the show... What do you think of it and the 'cancel culture'?
@LukeWatsonTX @bendreyfuss Are we in agreement that this show should be part of cancel culture.
Here’s my question: was John Derbyshire “cancelled”? Is that an example of “cancel culture”?  https://t.co/5eVtT9YDIn
Donald Trump is president and may get re-elected in spite of everything. Kanye West is pushing on with a comeback by way of the time honored tradition of using Jesus to scam. Roman Polanski is still winning film awards. But go on about cancel culture.
From what I have observed, the most devastating consequences of "cancel culture" have been the right against the left. Cancel culture is a powerful tool for the right but it is largely ineffective for the left. Why adopting the right's tactics w/o thoughtful analysis concerns me.
So obviously cancel culture isn't real, but I wish there was a better name for the thing that happens when people who do believe in it try to get people cancelled.   Maybe Online Outrage Machine?
Honest question: has anyone seen an attempt to define the concept of "cancel culture" in any systematic or rigorous way
cancel culture was too weak for this energy  https://t.co/YzuQ75T8Ty
Can someone plz ID 4 me when "cancel culture" or "outrage culture" began? How is this supposedly new phenomenon different from any other decade in society when the public  complained about something &amp; advertisers or programmers responded accordingly to keep consumer confidence?
@EggerDC You've cancelled cancel culture!
Comedians are starting to speak up against the cancel culture. Good. We need more of that. #SaturdayNightLive  https://t.co/F5xaPJxEze
There's no such thing as cancel culture. It's called being held accountable for your actions, and people are taking less shit these days. It should be called support culture, because people see they have allies who'll stand with them.
Today on @KFCradio, @garyowencomedy has a message for the world on behalf of comics everywhere   🗣 You can’t cancel us 🗣  We need to stop acting like cancel culture is the death of comedy. Comedy is FINE. Everyone is still telling jokes and getting paid boatloads of money  https://t.co/PzzUJvwolU

how much of the outrage against “cancel culture” is just indignity at the idea that someone would lose an opportunity over casual bigotry?
Brilliantly written story about the state of #comedy and #cancelculture. Comedy has to be given hall passes. The point of it is to be inappropriate, challenge us, push boundaries &amp; say the unsayable. Not that there are no lines, but there should be few, and context is everything.

@angela_cassiani I felt sad when i saw the clip. But I was even more sad that he went there and it wasn’t funny. Just an ugly conversation. He has the right to say it, cancel culture is wrong but people have the right to call racist things racist as well.
@cherry_LA @AkilahObviously What I keep seeing happening is rapid platform elevation where the supposed victim of cancel culture (Milo and Tulsi Gabbard are two non-partisan choices that come to mind immediately) decided the world was a private Facebook group. It is not. So they were held to account.
@cherry_LA @AkilahObviously My views have evolved on this, and this is my current view: there is no cancel culture. There is pop culture and outrage culture. When they intersect, the Jolie household answers for her father's statements but she doesn't lose her jobs, plural. It's a stage so act like it.
To everyone whining about the “PC mob” and “cancel culture” wrt Shane Gillis today: Just because fewer people spoke up about racist portrayals/remarks in the past, doesn’t mean it didn’t still hurt just as much
The people who get most upset about cancel culture are the asswipes you want to cancel the most. In our shitty capitalist system nobody is entitled to a job, especially not racists
You know what @donlemon &amp; @ChrisCuomo talking about comedy isn’t? Funny. Or enlightening. Or informative. Lemon is pushing his #CancelCulture fiction which i assume he pulled out of his ass while misrepresenting Pryor and Lenny Bruce. Thank you. Goodnight. #CancelCNN @CNN
@Osi_Suave The whole thing about "Cancel Culture" is Dismissing or throwing away people who dont agree with you.  God wont need to "cancel" me if I already agree with him. So he does Cancel people who dont agree with him.  Except if you dont understand what Cancel Culture means.
@JimNorton Glad we got to have this discussion with you in the film. It’s wild how much deeper down the rabbit hole we’ve gone even in the past few weeks. Seems like all anyone wants to talk about is Cancel Culture now!  https://t.co/r9SgOXOFjx #CancelCulture #snl
“People see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about their thing as much as they do.” - @rickygervais on cancel culture  Perfection.

"Cancel culture" is a  "mutated" form of McCarthyism, Sarah Silverman says     https://t.co/DFVDVMOtTw
The joke about “cancel culture” is that for all the “free speech” bs ? It’s mostly these entitled folks scared shitless that other folks can come take their JOBS.
What you need to know about “cancel culture” is that the complaints ABOUT cancel culture ? Didn’t actually pop off with social media and the Twitter non no matter wha anybody tries to tell you. It’s the rise of STREAMING SERVICES.
CROWDED is about actual cancel culture
In gym class in the 5th grade I fell on my back from the top of the cargo net.  As I was laying on the floor with the wind knocked out of me, my gym teacher, Ms Pfeiffer said "Good, you deserved it!'  It was my first taste of cancel culture.  I have been chasing that ever since
@ericszyszka Probably defending him because cancel culture is crazy and the person he referenced in the joke forgave him and presented the context of comedy....  https://t.co/jBPfuY4qoe
@thomas_violence People care about cancel culture, but not the lord’s answer
On second thought, maybe cancel culture hasn’t gone far enough
@jessesingal @spamofthemic @anaaronfreeman @mattyglesias yep, and the same could be said of "cancel culture" as well—good faith clarificatory work on both is great; bad faith "this is a bullshit term b/c deployed against causes I favor" is not so great
@m_k_oz @youngsinick @omarsuleiman504 That’s really unfortunate timing. But anybody who utters the expression “cancel culture” is considered bad news by anybody with integrity
@jessesingal @spamofthemic @anaaronfreeman @mattyglesias I agree definitions are important, and pinning down "privilege" or "cancel culture" or "free speech" or "nature" means can be extremely useful...provided the definitional work isn't a cloak for saying "[X] hard to define thing is therefore not real."
@jessesingal @spamofthemic @anaaronfreeman @mattyglesias Looking at your OP, safe to say you think "cancel culture" is a new term for something that is bipartisan and has always existed? A tough to define term, like "nature" or "free speech" or "privilege"—useful to identify a phenomenon that's accelerating or deserves attention?
@asymmetricinfo @kdrum @mattyglesias right and our brains were built to do the opposite, to attend to that sort of feedback because what if we get cast out of the village and a lion eats us (the original cancel culture)
@anaaronfreeman @mattyglesias I think Matt's right there are definitional problems here wrt cancel culture. And my own thoughts on it are partly about the behavior or internet randos and partly about how journalistic outlets sometimes make these instances worse with irresponsible reporting. So... lotta stuff
@omarsuleiman504 Glad you saw my tweet, hope you saw any of the 100’s of others that speak to the idea that forgiveness doesn’t mean freedom from criticism or consequences &amp; is not the property of those who weren’t harmed to offer  &amp;”canceling” isn’t real. Nor is “cancel culture”   Go Saints
“cancel culture is stifling art.”     https://t.co/IezZRoG5fp
Cancel Culture deniers are willfully ignorant at this point.
@mattyglesias As I said to another replier, I think it's not a great term. But when I see a spate of people tweeting that it's insane to think "cancel culture" is real or worth worrying about, my sense is they're saying there's nothing to worry about with regard to society gettin ga bit more
@thecla923 @mattyglesias i'm sympathetic to the idea that it' snot a great term. to be honest i was mostly tweeting about it because there's been a spate of LOL THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CANCEL CULTURE tweets
Cancel culture is like capitalism, but when it hurts White people.
Yes, I agree with cancel culture (whatever that means anyway). 😬

@saddy_valuepack those who deny cancel culture exists will be cancelled immediately
2/ I understand this is just one example, anecdotes, blah blah blah, but it does feel like overnight all the progressive journalists decided CANCEL CULTURE ISN'T REAL was the new orthodoxy and are feverishly defending it rather than having a more productive conversation about
I'm not saying there was ever some wonderful golden age where people DIDN'T do this, but it's insane to argue cancel culture doesn't exist when you can see people right in these replies looking for ways to professionally punish this dude for a newspaper column
One day, but not today, I will write my long-brewing Internet Essay™ about how all of the hand-wringing about cancel culture is actually just a function of a capitalist discourse that seeks to silence dissent from (most frequently minority) consumers
wait, i didn't know there was a 'cancel culture doesn't exist and no one can define it' take.
Interesting conversation between  @DonLemon and @ChrisCuomo on CNN, spending 10 minutes now talking about “cancel culture” and the firing of Shane Gillis. They presented both sides but ultimately each came down on the side that SNL should not have fired Gillis.
@Mike2600 @djayres @COUSINCOLE Also i love that people are freaking out about “cancel culture” when literally all these people have shows lol
More fitting way to correct dude on about that tweet (re: the Saints bringing up the Bible) because cancel culture is majorly a figment of people's imagination anyway.
@_Almaqah It was unoriginal shit about cancel culture
I just assumed “cancel culture” was about making dinner plans in Los Angeles. (Gently places three fingers on mouth, winks)
@_Almaqah I don't wanna use the term cancel culture cuz I agree with 99% of it but how has he not been canceled? I turned it off 5 min in
@andylevy the original tweet's stupidity washes over me in waves. There might not have been any 'cancel culture' on earth until organized religion.
Basically, delete the tweet, delete the discourse. Your takeaway from this if you don’t know much is: Every Quranic verse starts with the statement that God is allmerciful, meaning in death not in life. I don’t think this relates to cancel culture much nor to pre-Quranic ‘events’
Shane Gillis is gonna have a sold-out bro tour and a million dollar payday Netflix special about how he is a brave truthteller silenced by cancel culture called Saturday Night Dead within the year, bet on it.
For the record, people who cry “cancel culture” are afraid of being canceled. You all have skeletons in the closet and you’re too lazy to get rid of them.
If cancel culture was a real thing @realDonaldTrump wouldn’t still be president.

.@Shanemgillis Gets The #CancelCulture VIP Package from @nbcsnl, @AndrewYang Wonders If It's Too Far via @GabrielJHays1  https://t.co/w1TD2eL4pu
So much of being in the crosshairs of “cancel culture” could be resolved by offering a *sincere* apology. It’s the folks that double down on their actions that catch the worst of it.
The left eats their own mediocre comedians like Shane Gillis.  The only successful comedians who are funny and still worth watching (Burr, Gervais, Rogan etc) all reject and actively oppose cancel culture.  Surely this should serve as a lesson to upcoming comedians?
When #CancelCulture comes for me, remember me fondly.
Me: This is cancel culture at its worse  Judge: You embezzled $70,000 from a cancer charity! And spent it all on Hearthstone cards!  Me: The PC police strike again. Orwell was right
Sweetgreen participating in toxic cancel culture by asking me to buy something or cry outside
@thesalteater I don't think I fall in the category of people you described, but I have verbally been against cancel culture on here. I believe in restoration and feel the notion of cancellation doesn't allow people to be absolved or grow beyond without whatever being recalled.
Yang's going to give him $1,000/month for a year so he can make money without the fear of cancel culture
PS i don't really feel bad making a tweet about a corny topic that 10000 people are all rushing to weigh in on bc i know all the real heads have had the phrase "cancel culture" on their mute list for months now  salute!
I love that it's news that an employer can fire you for basically any reason their heart desires now that it happens to rich, privileged white men? Like, where was "cancel culture" when my retail manager fired me because she thought I was stuck up because I was going to college?
@kylaTea i wish they'd decide if it's "cancel culture" or "censorship" because all these brands are confusing
"cancel culture" is just the misleading name that the enemy has given to the idea of an equal future where we might one day be able to do to them what they now spend all day trying to do to us   https://t.co/ZIRaousEop

Cancel culture has been in conflict from The Very Beginning
Hard to disagree with SNL’s decision to let Shane Gillis go, but what about with their official statement. Has cancel culture gone too far &amp; is SNL being hypocritical?
My favorite historical cancel culture moment: an entire people canceled a big ass wall. Just tumbled it because they had enough. Bloody brilliant.  https://t.co/bvzOfaL9wc

Cancel culture isn't real, you fucking simpletons.
@edercampuzano His whole deal was smiting people for a while, wasn't it? That's like, extreme cancel culture.
If cancel culture existed wouldn't we be free of racists by now? There are plenty of jobs I can't get with my potty mouth twitter habits, Shane, the chinless racist doesn't get his job, the world keeps turning, jesus wept, etc.,
@madelineefry i read your argument. "It's cancel culture when people who are inoffensive are cancelled. Good when it's offensive people who are cancelled"  this is a vox take. give yourself a pat on the back
To clarify, I do think cancel culture is out of control and reactionary, but I was not speaking about SNL’s Gillis. I was referring to the people who want the casting directors who hired him fired. I mean, c’mon....
People who deny “cancel culture” is a real thing are stomping their and throwing a fit that it took four whole days for them to get their way and ruin Shane Gillis.
@AndrewYang I’m glad Shane reached out and I hope you are able to find some way to redeem him. Americans are sick of cancel culture and you can perhaps teach us a lesson about how to rise above it and move on humanely.
Andrew Yang reached out to Shane to have an actual dialogue abt this stuff, and Shane accepted. This would be how things progress. Not caving to you animals in the “cancel culture” mob.
@omarsuleiman504 western religion is the original cancel culture
All these man babies crying about how cancel culture is ruining the world clearly never had to confront their problematic views, and it shows.

Ain’t no such thing as "cancel culture" bruh. Woody Allen out here making all the movies he wants OJ Simpson is out here trying to give Antonio Brown life advice. Tweets is done.
Sorry, but the only "cancel culture" I'm seeing these days is the epidemic of trans women, particularly Black trans women, being brutally murdered while the greater public and media mostly look the other way.
@cjane87 I honestly want a Weeds podcast dedicated to this overarching question of God, Christ, and cancel culture.  Easily best episode of all time.
If you have any hesitation about whether cancel culture exists, allow me to invoke the Law of Conservation of Mass Energy to help clear this up because it states: "matter and energy are neither created nor CANCELED, sis."

Cancel culture is gonna be a bitch at Thanksgiving this year
I had to tell the Android news feed I wasn't interested in "culture" so it would finally stop showing me essays on "cancel culture"
I wish I felt bad about this. Cancel Culture can be extreme. But comics bring their entire portfolio to work at SNL. Many beloved characters started on local stages. How you get to SNL can be as important as what you do on it.  Also, I’ll bet Jenny Slate feels vindicated today.
Cancel culture is getting a lot of control.
Cancel culture in comedy is real.   For example, @jaboukie's tweets get cancelled every day
Ah yes, cancel culture: formerly known as “consequences”
We really should stop with this cancel culture and instead be quiet and wait until racists stop using derogatory slurs all on their own...as they have done throughout history, right?
Cancel culture but it’s cis het friends gradually withdrawing themselves from my life after I transitioned.
When cancel culture suits you. Also, this undermines your thesis that the Left doesn’t tackle antisemtism, as I reported here : https://t.co/VOsl7ZVjNX
answering my own question: i think that eventually we are all going to be so PC that there’s never going to be anything to dig up and therefore cancel culture will cancel itself.
Do you think cancel culture is here to stay or will it eventually fade away? (Serious question and not a limerick.)
@jbarro Exactly--ironically, it's some of the "cancel culture" complainers that want simplistic standards: "[person] said [offensive thing] and didn't get fired!" Yeah: maybe that person was actually making a satirical point and people applied judgment! That's, uh, good, right?
Maybe the goalposts haven't moved much in either direction. Those complaining about "cancel culture" will note "they" tried to do this to Trevor Noah and Melissa Villaseñor, too. But that didn't work! Maybe we're actually weighing facts &amp; circumstances and making nuanced choices.
Shane Gillis will be crying to Joe Rogan, Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro about “cancel culture” and how not being able to toss around racial slurs in the name of “comedy” violates his free speech. He has a lucrative career as a right wing grifter ahead of him.
@nbcsnl @Shanemgillis @chloefineman @bowenyang Well.....you were doing great @nbcsnl until you decided to pander to a small population of America that thrives off Cancel culture. You are becoming like MTV....you used to show comedy.
@theshrillest the bible is probably the only place where cancel culture really does exist
@PhayqNaim @nbcsnl @Shanemgillis The mob and SNL are all hypocrites. I am against cancel culture.
People whose opinion I actually value: if any one of you ever uses "cancel culture" in earnest I will shit in your ear.
"Cancel culture isn't real until we weaponize it but then it's considered justice."   Never been so terrified in my life.
Absolutely disgusting example of cancel culture.
The really disturbing thing about the "cancel culture" defense of Gillis is that it tries to rebrand as "PC overreach" something that had just been an accepted norm of human decency. The Michael Richards incident was 13 years ago!
God loves cancel culture pass it on
@DonnieDoesWorld @AndrewYang My problem with his response was the "pushing boundaries" thing. He wasn't cutting up some sort of new, "fresh" joke. I think "cancel" culture around comedians is absurd and they SHOULD be edgy, but his stuff was just flat out not funny and lazy.
The next few days of comedians whining abt cancel culture is going to be corny and exhausting
When people condemn "cancel culture" as oppositional to compassion, grace, and mercy they are speaking the language of spiritual abuse. It's also gaslighting.  Compassion, grace &amp; mercy don't always mean allowing access or giving continued to support. Have boundaries, friends.
Congratulations to everyone saying cancel culture isn't real on getting Shane Gillis fired.
I always find it funny when people talk about cancel culture ruining someone's life. But they just lose one big job that the the vast majority of all humans won't have. Their punishment is being normal lol  https://t.co/jjuVEyIyZj
@Pennstatedanny @OneTwoT88465894 @AndrewYang While I agree the cancel culture has grown out of control, this was not a “slip up”. His words were not “taken out of context” nor did he accidentally say something he didn’t mean. The terrifying things he talked about were his true thoughts. Good for SNL.
Given how much audience &amp; funding there is for anti-"cancel culture" content these days, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see a big-$$ Netflix special from Gillis sooner or later. What a weird zeitgeist!
Of all the critiques of "cancel culture" the "God doesn't cancel people" take is the most laughable and dishonest.  Like, what?! Have you ever read a page of the Bible in your life? God was "canceling" people by the thousands. It was called nation-building, though..
4. That's the thing about so-called cancel culture, you can un-cancel someone, especially comics! They can go on tour, they can have their own podcast, they can write a book. Really have an issue with cancel culture? Open up your wallet.   Talk is cheap.
3. With the number of people complaining about Shane Gillis being cancelled (he hasn't been), he should be able to sell out Radio City for 3 nights. But that probably won't happen because people who complain about cancel culture rarely put their money where their mouth is
this is what a zero percent sorry, totally does not grasp how awful this is, absolutely knows this will fuel the flames of anti-cancel culture bros statement looks like
Also just can't wait for all the takes about how "cancel culture" means you can't even defend straight-up racism as "pushing boundaries" anymore.
If there was any way to save his job, it wasn't via that smug, condescending iOS press release he put out not responsibility and insinuating people offended by his racism didn't mean it. Cancel culture is not nearly as potent as some think it is, but no, you can't be that stupid.
OH OH HERE COMES CANCEL CULTURE
This was the correct call.   Plus, his name recognition has only increased. I'm sure he's going to have a whole new slate of material about how cancel culture has become so sensitive you can't even be virulently racist in a publicly available forum without facing ramifications!
@bariweiss @tabletmag Wow. You’re loving “cancel culture” when the people you want to be silenced are silenced. You are so tired.
The electoral college sucks. Ok cancel culture, do your thing!  https://t.co/vYo36l8ik4
@BlitzkaSteph @MasterHavik @TheRogueSquad @NicholasThorn7 @RocknSun91 @JessWalt1 I completely agree. Just seems that these people who are so anti-cancel culture are usually the same ones who want to cancel women who speak. Go figure, huh?
@TheRogueSquad @MasterHavik @NicholasThorn7 @RocknSun91 @JessWalt1 Maintaining a successful career is not cancel culture. Holding people socially accountable for their actions is not cancel culture. An inability to take responsibility for their actions is not cancel culture. Finally having a voice and using it is not cancel culture.
No surprise that @LATimesTVLloyd's conversation with @SarahKSilverman for @latimes' Emmy preview is wide-ranging and provocative — covering subjects from antisemitism, death threats and political rage to Dave Chappelle and cancel culture:  https://t.co/tDz7J7WmBU
@TimLillie @JayRuderman @billburr @netflix Agree whole-heartedly.  Not asking for #CancelCulture response, just understanding of the community that continues to be marginalized in this arena
Comedian Adam Carolla unloaded on “cancel culture” and social justice warriors during a Comedy Central show, remarking, “Comedians need a place where they can be offensive without your bullshit, fake outrage.”   https://t.co/ogGgJJq0Fc
South Park was renewed for a 26th season. Really wondering how the upcoming season will work in this current state of cancel culture we're living in. Hopefully business as usual.   Will they even be affected by that bs?  Will Cartman find love again?  Should I have more coffee?
Fun fact: There used to be a saying all Americans agreed on. It went, "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it". #CancelCulture Now it's...  https://t.co/QChhSHFCnH
@brestonparfield But again, would love for you to provide examples of ANY comedians whose careers have been destroyed by "cancel culture." It's this boogeyman people like you love citing without any evidence. I invite you to unpack that a bit!
@brestonparfield Once again, would love for anyone to list the comedians whose careers have been ruined by "cancel culture." Dave Chappelle faced some criticism? OK. He's still wildly successful and will continue to make millions doing comedy. What exactly is the problem?
@mattyglesias Maybe not the first, but God canceling most of the human race with the flood seems like a big deal #CancelCulture  https://t.co/40udPmndNO

Real “cancel culture” is putting out a tweet like this and erasing the fact that @Kaepernick7 did it first. (Yes, I know Kap did it in a playoff game. Then say “in the regular season”.)
Thank you for attending this production of "The Crucible" in which the Salem Witch Trials serve as a powerful condemnarion of cancel culture. It may seem anachronistic for Abigail Williams and her classmates to all use cell phones in colonial Massachusetts however as a director I
If you are screaming CANCEL CULTURE to avoid the discomfort of someone asking for respect, you have become a cog in the capitalist wheels. Capitalism is really good at making you think you’re screaming free speech when you’re actually just defending some rich guy’s business model
I’m shocked that no one’s written a contemporary novel on cancel culture. I think I’ll do it.
Zoe Quinn didn’t force anyone to cancel Alec Holowka with false allegations of sexual assault. She may have lied, but everyone else chose to do it on their own cognizance. Cancel culture is a choice. Own it.
@joshgondelman I had to put that jk at the end because with this cancel culture people will take that tweet and say I was serious!!! that's our new code. (jk)
A few topics we focus on - Cancel culture, Privilege, #Metoo...  between Felicity Huffman’s sentence, Shane Gillis vs @AndrewYang &amp; newly uncovered Brett Kavanaugh allegations...these topics are getting more and more important - tackle them with us on #ModernRuhles
Honestly, the constant posts and messages for the last 13 years that my opinion columns are biased are some of what makes life worth living. Where is my nyt perch to complain about cancel culture?
@jennlavayen also he's fine. this website is fake. like this drama is just on twitter and some entertainment blogs. he has a job and will work forever. nobody is actually censoring anyone. cancel culture is fake. also he's not my friend and he sees nothing wrong with what he said. btw.
Cancel culture has me all sorts of nervous watching this roast, but so far Sean Hayes is perfection. #BaldwinRoast
Attempting three field goals from inside the five is cancel culture send tweet
People whining about “cancel culture” are strangely uncomfortable with anyone experiencing a consequence in extremely competitive field.
“Cancel culture” is a weird way of phrasing “wondering why you’re racist.”
@wretchedcretin Also I never said I was outraged. I just don’t get why people not wanting Shane Gillis on snl bc of racist comments is cancel culture. Just seems like a logical reaction that Asians would get mad when someone uses slurs? Like what did he think would happen lol
It seems like all the people who hate cancel culture...really want it cancelled.  https://t.co/1BPgcTKdfy
Cancel culture, social justice warriors, twitter mafia, outrage mobs, PC culture, hysteria ... and tomorrow there will be a new term, to broadly delegitimize the basic act of people speaking up, rather than engaging with actual cases and arguments
It’s not “the left” that does “cancel culture” they accuse us of it bc it scares them that people like me might have power. And then they use the very “cancel culture” they lament to try to get people like me fired. They tried to cancel me twice in a year.
@knobetter @YuniiiQ Nah. Not to the degree of the whites. As “the whites” get all up in arms about #cancelculture to the point where they’re making tons of anonymous troll accounts. Hahaa. Nice header BTW. Very believable.  https://t.co/8uDWcemanq
A lot of people privately ask me why I worry about cancel culture. Surely the consequences tend to be trivial...  Here's one example: The judge who gave Brock Turner an overly lenient sentence has just been fired from his second career *as a tennis coach*.  https://t.co/Ityyb2GMfl  https://t.co/hC99QKHcwU
‘Cancel culture:’ euphemism for black users invoking the power of Twitter to call out racists/racism because there’ll otherwise be no professional or societal consequence.   Good thing white men are here to show us the appropriate way to assert our humanity instead.
I love @billmaher &amp; his show, but this is a fantastic &amp; classy response by @JKCorden. In a time when it would have been easy for Corden to invoke cancel-culture type calls to protest, he instead rebutted Bill's argument with respect and reason. Disagreement should look like this.
@AliNotAlli @LumpOfDirtyCoal @OCWeekly Death threats have nothing to do with cancel culture - those are fringe weirdos. I've lived with those for years, too, nobody should threaten you.  But your choices DO affect others. You're excusing racism - that's not the same as saying you don't like beets. See what I mean?
@arthur_affect I love Ray Bradbury but Fahrenheit 451 has not aged well and sounds a bit Old Man Yells At Clouds these days, especially the blame he throws at marginalized groups. Even in his day they were complaining about safe spaces and cancel culture 😐
I don't think cancel culture is the correct term. It's true ppl continue to benefit from bad acts despite calls to "cancel" them. It's more shame culture or pile on culture or pot meet kettle culture. And the issue is that this is an oft-ineffective strategy that frustrates many.
Liberals: I stand with Andrew Yang Conservatives: Yang thinks cancel culture has gone too far Centrists: Yang is a very reasonable man trying to find a middle ground.
@ggreenwald @aminatou I really want a redo so we can have the full cancel culture conversation.
@LumpOfDirtyCoal @AliNotAlli @OCWeekly Blaming cancel culture for people getting mad at you for your own bad choices is being like the 7th grade girl who gossips about her friends and then blames them when nobody likes her anymore.
New SNL Hire In ‘Cancel Culture’ Crosshairs Over Past Offensive Jokes. Here’s His Response.  https://t.co/YJqX2OoAQG
I wish cancel culture would cancel MY PLANS!
Why don’t conservatives point to denying @Kaepernick7 employment for two years and counting as an example of “cancel culture?” Seems to me to be the ultimate example. He didn’t lose a couple of endorsements. He lost the whole thing, with their encouragement...
WOW!! @AndrewYang is GREAT!! He would make a mighty fine President or Secretary of Treasury. He's above cancel culture, presents policies that takes the edge off of the working class, and has an aura of leadership I can get behind. #politics #2020Election
Cancel culture should be called time-out culture.   Because when people say they've been cancelled, they're really just been asked to go sit in a corner and think about what they've done for 15 minutes.
Whites are so bent out of shape about what they think “cancel culture” is all about because they’ve literally cancelled entire cultures. 🤷‍♂️
these are, distilled, precisely the stakes in this debate. "cancel culture" is about power, about those IN power demanding those WITHOUT power be silent.
my hot take is that the history of racial slurs is a history of violence and people who throw them around against racial minorities ought to be ostracized but i guess that might be “cancel culture”  https://t.co/lQjRiMkZy4
ah yes, the unreasonable “cancel culture” of racial minorities who decide they don’t want to sit down with people who call them slurs
Yang rejecting the knee-jerk cancel culture is encouraging.
THIS RIGHT HERE. “Cancel culture” is a weapon of the right to undermine anyone demanding an equal voice and respect in the public arena. Just like “political correctness” was used to undermine people demanding respect for their personhood before.
Andrew Yang shows forgiveness and humanity, rejecting calls to feed into the cancel culture.  A glimpse of grace.
yeah I do agree we should cancel culture
The attitude in the tweet above explains why it was so hard to get sexual assault taken seriously at university on at least two occasions. Cancel culture does not exist because if it did those men responsible would not have had degrees or careers.
in naming it "cancel culture," it gets undue distinction as "something unique," but it is not  it's the exact opposite; it's an unspecific thing that "only the bad guys do"  when it's really just competition baked into socialization so completely, even leftism is capitalism
as a person who gets pointed at as obsessed with "cancel culture" I hate its given name perhaps more than any aspect of it  it's really just a catch all for various competitive behaviors that have been marketed as normal accelerating in the internet era
@iproposethis @OCWeekly They sure do and they love me. Probably became they don't fold to harassment of woman by woman and #CancelCulture.
I don’t get what cancel culture has to do with Asians not wanting a racist being a celebrity on SNL. Shane Gillis was being himself on that podcast. I didn’t see him telling any joke. A comedian pushes boundaries - a racist uses comedy as an excuse to be a fucking cunt.
@the_real_MCV @monicabyrne13 There is no cancel culture cannon.  Though that is amusing alliteration.
@nytopinion You deleted 2 tweets so far including your previous apology because you didn’t like the comments. Cancel culture is a bit too much for you to handle? Deal with it. Your organization and others love it for clicks and views like a bunch of grifters. This is the fire you play with.
*awkwardly confronted by trey stone at a party* no I LOVED “BASEketball” ... its just that damn cancel culture ...
to call the secret service on me for his misrepresentation of my joke. LMAO. Cancel Culture, indeed.
what I'm saying is, pay attention to who actually is part of cancel culture, who actually does manufacture outrage. And remember that the pussies calling us over here soft tried to get me "cancelled" twice in the last year.
Cancel culture is contagious. If someone chooses to show love to or publicly support the one being dragged, they somehow are deemed canceled too.  What is this world we are living in??
The only solution to PC/Cancel culture in comedy is to finally elevate puns to the pantheon of humor, where they rightfully belong.
Cancel culture is toxic.
A serial rapist president got a serial sexual assailant confirmed for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.  Cancel culture absolutely doesn’t exist.
I was at Williams this week w/@mollywood &amp; @aminatou for a great discussion on social media. Aminatou argued "cancel culture" is a myth, a fiction, &amp; while I don't fully agree, Bari Weiss is strong support for her view: held up as a classic victim of it, yet "cancelled" nowhere:
@nytopinion The New York Times should experience some of this cancel culture they and other media outlets love so much. Play with fire, get burned. You deserve it.
“Cancel culture is ruining the careers of brave, edgy comedians!” - people who have no money to spend on comedy or comedians, apparently
CANCEL  CULTURE  Just cancel the whole thing. Let's just not do anything
@olive_thethings @KylaPadbury @Sarcasticmormon Where's cancel culture when we need it
@jamesrbuk say no to cancel culture, James
@amesishuni Over an unspoken assumption is pretty disheartening. It would go against everything I’ve ever said, done or stood for. So it hurts.  Cancel culture is very real and it’s going to make artists stop connecting with fans on a real level for fear of being misinterpreted like this.
Remember kids it's not "cancel culture" when media executives or publishers do it, only when thousands of people who have no voice or institutional power except their numbers do it.
Speaking of cancel culture, there’s a Chris Brown concert in Brooklyn tonight.
@adamnash @m2jr No the whole point of 'cancel culture' is if someone says anything that even mildly offends someone somewhere the online mob must attack said person until they've lost their job and livelihood. Imagine when they discover YouTube.
Shane Gillis doesn’t call Asians “chinks” or make fun of them like this to push boundaries. This isn’t comedy. This is hate. SNL continuing to employ him is a huge disgrace. Cancel culture has its excesses but this is a case for appropriate accountability.  https://t.co/G5UH3E2IGg
@DrNick513 They all say that shit, just as they reference all the comedians whose careers have supposedly been ruined by cancel culture without being able to name a single one.
Maybe there ARE some people out there who genuinely enjoy ripping people apart for things they've done. I am not one of those people. I AM critical of cancel culture and not comfortable with it. But a spade is a fucking spade. How are you helping this conversation by excusing it?
If you whine about “cancel culture” in entertainment, I expect you to be also advocating for actresses who can’t get work after they turn 40.  Like you BETTER be rioting in the streets until Bridget Fonda lands a prestige HBO show.
Cancel culture is taking my sleep from me!
But yea I'm not trying to see cancel culture anymore. It's lame, and most of y'all really don't care unless you see a way to profit from it. Truth hurts I know, but says a lot. For the oversensitivity I see, I laugh more than in annoys 😂. I love my homies on here and most of
@ebruenig @CarlBeijer I mean, people who have done really heinous things—Cosby, Weinstein—are no longer accepted into polite society. But these are rare cases. Cancel culture seems mainly a bugbear for @Quillette set.
@PatrickGman @AndrewYang There’s a case to be made that cancel culture on social media has run amok where people get destroyed and smeared without due process, without facts, and without evidence. That must absolutely stop. But calling Andrew Yang a chink on a public podcast is a bridge too far.

@nicizzi I’d say having to change your name just to work behind the scenes is a hearty cancellation.  And none of this is to say he’s innocent by the way (there’s so much contradicting info on the death and trial), but just to say that cancel culture definitely isn’t new.
People who think “cancel culture” is new have definitely never heard of Fatty Arbuckle.
The best thing to happen in Cancel Culture to date.
@megh_wright @cottoncandaddy I’d have a discussion with you but you don’t believe in cancel culture (yet you stand in the middle of it) so we don’t even live on the same planet.
@karlbykarlsmith @EricLevitz @mattyglesias @jonathanchait @dandrezner @cjane87 These are all weapons. “PC,” “cancel culture,” “woke,” etc., don’t just describe the rhetorical war. They’re part of it. They frame our side as victims and your side as mean and humorless.
Also... I think all this talk about how cancel culture doesn’t exist may be a semantic issue. I’ve never thought of “cancelation” as literal cancelation, and a year ago we called it “call-out culture” (same principle, less catchy name) and no one argued that it was a myth.
the saddest part is, we could end all of this right now if someone would just tweet "how about CANCEL CULTURE is canceled??"   such a shame.
i agree that we should cancel culture
I’m fine with cancel culture as long as someone acknowledges my pioneering work in the “clean-not-mean” comedy revolution!

@joepabike @realDonaldTrump Yup. Joy already stood up to cancel culture and she will stand up to this Racist-in-Chief, Donald J. Trump, without breaking a sweat.
@jaycaspiankang I think it goes in both directions. People are giddy at the prospect of cancelling someone whose platform has gotten too big for their platform britches too. I mostly feel “cancel culture” where it exists and succeeds mostly operates to undercut people whose power is tenuous.

@jeremy6d @liz_franczak You might argue that Robespierre was the first victim of cancel culture
@OsitaNwanevu From now on, anyone complaining about “cancel culture” should have to give an example of it at work. If it’s such a problem, there should be lots of examples. Also, bonus points if the example isn’t a stand up comedian.
@MarkDiStef @davey I warned y'all that cancel culture would eventually come and hurt the left. No sense in being salty about the world y'all helped to build :P
One of the best articles on “Cancel-Culture” I’ve ever read..

Great question. I got nothing.  Also, have dudes actually learned anything or are they just sitting around writing shitty standup sets about cancel culture?

If you’re making the argument that “cancel culture doesn’t exist” maybe refrain from following it up with “name one person who didn’t deserve it!”
@cottoncandaddy @megh_wright You guys aren’t worth the effort. But good luck with cancel culture, bud.
@PatrickGman I think at the core of his apology is an understanding that more than half the people "upset" are feigning outrage as part of infectious cancel culture, while also acknowledging real upset exists and apologizing to them. It serves two purposes, to apologize &amp; point out a problem.
You like cancel culture so much well I am canceling my subscription to your

Cancel culture is absolutely a real thing and the people trying to tell you it’s not are the modern day equivalent of Inquisitors and they will happily condemn you to burn at the stake.
Netflix getting rid of Midsomer at the end of the month is cancel culture
The comedians are being used as high profile kill shots that let everyone else know they need to stfu, get in line or risk the same fate.  If you think cancel culture doesn’t exist—you don’t know anyone who has been canceled. Lucky you.
I’d be a lot more worried about “cancel culture” if we weren’t still doling out awards to Roman Polanski
Part of your job as an entertainer is to figure out how not to be hated. I deal with cancel culture daily*. I try not to be cancelled*, but if I am cancelled I say “Well, that’s what I signed up for”*  *not actually true
If you’re into cancel culture, then FINE! Cancel all the people you want! Just remember that cancellation is a DEATH WARRANT and in some rare cases people do die! It’s not like they can just return to their jobs within months or become proud boys! YOU PEOPLE ARE SICK
The people condemning “cancel culture” are often just lamenting the diminishment of their own power to decide what is acceptable discourse and rhetoric in our society.
Are there any good explainers on cancel culture, specifically on the difference between cancelation and plain old critique? Vox, strangely, seems not to have touched this one yet.

John Bolton was a victim of cancel culture. Sad
@KateAurthur Why not just say "Shane Gillis Used Racial Slur"?   "Resurfaced" to me indicates some sort of digging around, which plays into the idea that cancel culture will comb through your old shit. But this video was available, and recent.
@EWErickson Keeping up with cancel culture is a full-time job.
Dunk tank clowns are the only true victims of “cancel culture”
Maybe instead of being mad about "cancel culture" you should learn to take criticism from Twitter in stride and adjust to a world where critics have direct access to you and you can't ignore them  [a bunch of conservatives get mad at me about something]  HELP I AM BEING HARASSED
The "cancel culture" discourse has gotten so dumb -- people just reciting the same mantras they were two years ago without actually explaining what they're for or against, what the rules should be, if it's fair if X vs Y vs Z gets fired, blah blah blah. Online ruins everything.
@alex_abads Cancel culture is galaxy brain good for Michael Che!!!!
My galaxy brain is that SNL hired a dude with easily Googleable racist shit in his not-even-past not only to get publicity for the show (medium brain) but also force us to have conversations about cancel culture F O R E V E R

I’d say I can’t wait til ur dream comes true so I can Google u/interview every dipshit whose feelings uve hurt but ur dream won’t come true bc ur not special &amp; u know that &amp; it’s why cancel culture is awesome 4 u bc it finally gave your meaningless life purpose. Also ur ugly.

I'd be more worried about cancel culture if 1) it was actually canceling all these people, and 2) the vast majority of people weren't able to avoid its wrath with the utmost ease
Honestly trying to think of one person who’s actually been cancelled in this chilling time of unrestrained cancel culture and so far I got maaaaaybe Lori Loughlin.
My last tweet was potentially too harsh. I’ll say it more calmly: if you are into cancel culture, you align yourself with the 1980’s PMRC, Moral Majority, and Religious Right. Yes, THAT Right. If that’s where you wanna be, God bless.
@AndrewHusband If I had to guess, he doesn’t care. Based on his Instagram feed, Che’s anti-cancel culture. He’d pretty side with “comedians gotta make jokes” or something.
@Variety Cancel culture needs to be canceled
What is the opposite of Cancel Culture? Because between Caroline Calloway and a human named PewDiePie (??) I feel assaulted by reverse obscurity.
@SirajAHashmi I hate cancel culture a ton, but who would use that word in 2018?! What was he thinking?!
@sasimons Preemptively: using the phrase "cancel culture" in relation to a guy who thought it'd be funny to say "let the ch*nks live [in Chinatown]" (in 2018!!) would be incorrect and bad, thanks

@_divinepulse @trashcoven No because it’s not about *my* situation, it’s mob mentality, bullying, and cancel culture as a whole. Which I think is cruel. So, my friends and I made art about it. You don’t need to support it or be happy about it 🖤
these guys think cancel culture actually works in the same way theyve been strawmanning it. just like their understanding of race is that of a childs “you criticized a black person now ur racist!” used to be a their straw man of the left’s arguments- now they do it unironically

@Popehat I served on the board of a domestic violence nonprofit with Judge Persky for years.m when he was a prosecutor—that’s how he spent his spare time. The idea that he is not fit to be a coach now, or a lawyer, or judge, or anything, is the absurd extreme of cancel culture. Very sad.
This is a very important episode re: the professional and personal implications of wrongful accusations and cancel culture, plus navigating mistakes-- please listen and share:
If "cancel culture" which I think has often been a very positive thing is going to continue to be positive and effective it needs to have limits.
Which is to say, cancel culture exists and it can be ruthless and it is, without question, unhealthy for a society that lives on the internet. But there are people who have made their living offending people and been so successful that they are out of cancel culture's reach.
Matt Stone declares "cancel culture" worse than ever on the same day @SouthPark gets picked up for 3 more seasons...
Okay, so: two mild critiques of this. 1) The reason it's different is because of the way the internet preserves things and because modern 'cancel culture' makes no room for reentry.  2) C'mon, South Park complaining about cancel culture when it's entering its 22nd season?
the right on a war high bullied large chunks of America into putting The Dixie Chicks in black sites, I have yet to see a cancel culture moment of the Obama or trump years that the New York Times op ed section has complained about that tops that

@EricRWeinstein @prageru 2/ zooming out a bit, modern "cancel culture" was definitely pushed primarily by the left and the left does it more, but worth noting that the 'older' version of exclusion that this was partly addressing was the far more prolific ostracizing of ethnic/racial/religious minorities.

Roman Polanski is proof that cancel culture isn’t terribly powerful   Thanks for coming to my TED Talk
@Ted_Underwood @ARoseCasey I think we agree there. But there's also a big leap from "valid sociological questions" to "a vaguely defined set of intersecting phenomena loosely grouped under the term 'cancel culture' is real."
if cancel culture exists, why are the Victorian couple and the one where the guy made her hate Jagged Little Pill both still walking our planet earth
I’m thinking about this as I think of all the white people but especially women who argued merit when discussing researching . I’m thinking SPECIFICALLY of how White Women used cancel culture
@Ted_Underwood This piece makes an important point about not preemptively shutting out potential allies. That's different from the idea that cancel culture — which holds that randos online have the power to shut down people like Bret Stephens — is a real thing.
People describe all sorts of things as "Orwellian" these days, but referring to criticism from people who don't like you as "cancel culture" is literally a case of changing language to suppress dissent.

to be very clear: I have serious problems with making randos into the gatekeepers of art, science, music—but that makes me an elitist, not an "opponent of cancel culture"  opponents of cancel culture should have the courage to own what they are actually saying
so...I think "cancel" culture has *always* existed  it's simply that the POWER to cancel people (or allow them a platform to begin with!) has shifted to a less defined, less elite public  we can debate the merits of that shift, but pretending cancel culture is new is silly

It's just online discourse that has the potential to form campaigns, like "Mute R. Kelly".   I think even the phrase "cancel culture" was created by people who dislike when their icons, idols, heroes, and inspirations are seen through critical lens.   "Shut up and enjoy."
It's not about "cancel culture" existing as much as it is the influence of celebrity and entertainment culture on the current sociopolitical climate, or how lack of critique of both cultures can reinforce compliance with unethical and immoral actions and behavior.

@LeaLevers I think the penalising affects that come with shame and cancel culture exacerbate people's inability to speak on topics that are present in our community or country. A lot of internal work gets muted further by the trending voice of shame, or am I wrong? 🤦🏾‍♂️

Learning to be more sensitive to the painful experiences of others—experiences we might not be aware of because of our isolation or privilege—isn’t “political correctness” or “cancel culture”; it’s simply the path to becoming a better, more compassionate, more empathetic person.
THAT being said, maybe we should do another @SubjectivityUK trial and punishment show on cancel culture? Be really interested to see how people govern themselves and wish to govern the world around them.

Cancel culture often keeps me from calling out cancel culture when it's wrong. So my cancel culture cancellation has been preemptively cancelled.
there's nothing reactionaries like more than the image of the left acting like them  and that's really all "cancel culture" is - punitive individualism (to steal a better term)
I'm going to say something that's probably going to piss a lot of people off, but you can't have "cancel culture is pretend" and "I wouldn't care if contrapoints died"  now, that doesn't mean "cancel culture" isn't a misnomer (it's a bad term), but something needs to give

@nytimes @felipeneto The human capacity to grow, to evolve, to learn, to reform, to recognize errors is often steamrolled by cancel culture, but is (and always has been) one of humanity's most valuable instruments for progress. It's a good reason to provide ample space for repentance &amp; dialogue.
@neontaster @karol @allahpundit But understanding that, I generally agree that one's outrage against actual "cancel culture" should be directed at neutralizing it, rather than perpetrating it ourselves and justifying that by pointing to opponents who also do it.
@neontaster @karol @allahpundit The thing is, there actually are things that people should be fired for. If a cop says on Facebook that he likes to beat blacks because he thinks they are subhuman, it's not "cancel culture" to demand his firing. So "oppose firings" is not a general principle I can support.
@neontaster @karol @allahpundit I named some. You pretended they are not part of the left because they are not part of the cancel culture left. I don't care for Bill Maher but he's another.
Anyone surprised by the Venice awards might not realise that cancel culture is a mainly UK/US phenomenon &amp; the juries are very much international cross-sections
@neontaster @karol @allahpundit Yes. But not ALL of the left is the cancel culture left, just like not ALL of the right opposes cancel culture even when it's leftists getting cancelled.
@SocialBlade Real-time is something no one will ever be able to see again with the new system it seems, outside of creators watching their own dashboards.    It was a cool tool while it lasted, even if used in a different way by cancel culture.  I heard that's a big reason for the change.
@Patterico A win would be if people on the left derided cancel culture like people on the right do. Where are the @allahpundit types writing pieces about not using old tweets to get people fired?

It was a privilege to be on @IngrahamAngle tonight to discuss "cancel culture" and its corrosive effect on our country.
“Mr. Mosley, it has been reported that you used the N-word in the writers’ room.”  I replied, “I am the N-word in the writers’ room.”  The great Walter Mosley explains why we should not silence others’ speech. Cancel culture, please take heed.   https://t.co/hC5RgpCDiZ

Right-wing cancel culture comes for Jamie Riley, who dared to criticize the American flag.   https://t.co/MhoTY0rrvz
@JeffreyASachs If you’d have included a tl;dr in your first thread you might have saved yourself a bit of headache. That’s not intended to be a strong criticism or to be argumentative. Just my 2 cent. I do appreciate you taking the time though. Cancel culture is bad for America.
Good for Drew Brees. Cancel culture has no power over you if you refuse to be cancelled.   https://t.co/bnmxb0lxRm via @usatoday
Ask the Dixie Chicks about this new cancel culture why doncha.
Here’s a thought — all those who loathe cancel culture and deplatforming should oppose cancel culture and deplatforming, no matter the target.
I’ve lost at least 57,000 followers by not boot licking the “MAGA” message such as air strikes in Syria are good now. 🥴  That’s not cancel culture.   Contrapoints isn’t being cancelled. Her fans decided they didn’t like her anymore.   Welcome to being a celebrity!
Contrapoints said something her fan base didn’t like, he fan base freaked, and someone she’s a victim?  Man I’ve lost 10,000 followers with a tweet. More than once.   Cancel culture is when you get fired, no-platformed, not when “called out” by the unhinged.
Have you heard the latest edition of #TheOne w/ @greggutfeld? @DanaPerino, @PlanetTyrus, @katTimpf &amp; @drdrew weigh in on the most &amp; least-friendly states in the U.S., "cancel culture" &amp; more. Rate, review &amp; subscribe on @ApplePodcasts or here:  https://t.co/7rMyHDOZnl
Yeah. If the argument is we shouldn't call it "left-wing cancel culture," that's fine with me. Right-wingers who claim their side doesn't do that are either ignorant or lying.
This week's all-new episode of Sacred Symbols+ is about Cancel Culture, GamerGate, and the increasingly destructive (and self-destructive) video game industry.  Let's candidly talk about all that's gone wrong, how, and why.  https://t.co/nAUbSs2T7S  https://t.co/b583tS0cpW
now my take is that “cancel culture” isn’t really a thing and that public space and acceptable discourse has always been highly contested and that the important dynamics have to do with who has power and who owns capital
the funny thing about the “left wing cancel culture run amok” discourse is that it exists in this strange time vacuum where people didn’t lose jobs and platforms for being insufficiently pro-war from 2002 to 2004
@KCicale @MStephensRich It's not worth arguing.  Remember, he's a troll.  And this is what trolls do.  You'll never change his mind because that's not what he's after.  He's part of a cancel culture mentality and just wants to be angry at something... "just because."
Saying cancel culture isn’t a thing because people rich &amp; famous enough to weather the storm can survive it ignore the real life people who can’t.
Saying “cancel culture isn’t a thing” just means you’re part of the in-group going around ruining people’s lives for wrong-think and either don’t have to worry about it or don’t know anyone who had their life destroyed by an online mob.
People saying cancel culture isn’t a thing don’t know anyone who has been canceled.
@KCicale Thank you! We are fully aware that this has been a "cancel culture" campaign against us. It's been very obvious to us and many of the people we work with see it as well who have also sent us their message of support. We really do appreciate it!  Time to get back to the parks! 😍
@kaludiasays gotta do it be before “cancel culture” get me lmaooooo
@dicentra33 @Neoavatara @JayCaruso @benshapiro I object to hypocrisy above most things, so my main point is that the same people yelling about cancel culture right now are still trying to… cancel people.
@Neoavatara @JayCaruso @benshapiro My point was that my lifetime has seen a whole lot of cancel culture from the Right, not “cancel culture huzzah”
@FGasparGomez @cjane87 Yeah, that’s the MO for cancel culture. “hey, we’re just ACCIDENTALLY stumbled on this and just want to let everyone know it’s out there. Just asking questions. [insert shrug emoji]"

@flamingpetty there is A LOT of great commentary on this on tumblr if you do write this essay, both on cancel culture and the fandom version of "purity culture," which...isn't terribly far from the Christian term "purity culture" I suppose lol.
can we get this cancel culture thing I’ve been hearing about on the case here
@Anthonysmdoyle @TiWindisch Well, true.  But it doesn't mean the wave of hysteria doesn't happen. This West thing isn't a great example, but I think the downside of cancel culture is the effect it has on the discourse
“William Lacey claims he was asked to remove his shirt or leave the Senate by security.   Security allegedly did this due to the potentially offensive content the shirt depicted. This content was ‘I heart oil &amp; gas.’”   https://t.co/IdfLeaya4w  #Cdnpoli #CancelCulture
is this what they mean by 'cancel culture'?
But sure, cancel culture or something.
@EricLevitz @Noahpinion @bopinion Its popular in cancel culture and though you framed it obliquely the logic of your own argument supports that idea indeed its an accurate estimator of measure.
I bet people would be less pee-pantsed about “cancel culture” if we called it by its original name, “the free market.”
Working on that part of cancel culture
@satoshiksutra Ah, Dylan Matthews. LOL. See the thing is, I actually agree with his statement that it's important to have societal norms against explicit bigotry. But he doesn't seem to realize that 95%+ of what is targeted by "cancel culture" has nothing to do with explicit bigotry.
@J_E_Mac You seem to be confused about what cancel culture is supposed to be. Conservatives think it destroys careers; her career is better than fine. You seem to think it means any minor consequence.  But you're just a troll I forgot to block earlier, so time to remedy that now.
If you guys are serious about cancel culture, you know who goes next
@leasdef This is stan or cancel culture.
Cancel culture came for SoulCycle.   Thanks to Trump fundraiser boycotts, SoulCycle attendance is down.  https://t.co/PdkJZEJqil
Excellent piece. Although Olson's speedy and complete exoneration is also a breach in "cancel culture," no?
Good for @MeghanMcCain for calling-out the "cancel culture" who locate, label, &amp; lash-out at those with different perspectives/beliefs, then turn their life into a living Hell.  It's insane, intolerant and dangerous behavior.
An interesting thing about "cancel culture": almost every WhatsApp and Signal group I am part of manages to find a happy medium between upholding moral principles and treating people with kindness and nuance.  It's almost as if the affordances of Twitter might be playing a role.

The “Cancel Culture” is self-defeating. I mean, if I’ve been “Cancelled” more than 4 times, doesn’t logic dictate that I was never “Cancelled” at all? I mean, why keep letting me know that I’m “Cancelled”, if you “Cancelled” me 4 times ago? Please look up the word “indifference.”  https://t.co/Bl54APqJaH
I think cancel culture is going a bit far this morning with Dakota Fanning. the film is based on a novel. The character in the novel is also a white Ethiopian woman.
Keep your fuckin cancel culture if it has no room for empathy and rooted in hate.
y'all tryna get Kevin Hart outta here even thru tragedy lol i want nothing to do with cancel culture.
I think "cancel culture" is a misnomer, as it ascribes what I see as the incorrect problem to "excessive cancelling/callouts as the image of social justice"  it is aspects of capitalist socialization not addressed by simply calling oneself a leftist

@J_E_Mac Yes, exactly. As many of us have repeatedly pointed out, "cancel culture" mostly hurts the marginalized. Attempts to cancel the privileged bounce off or get deflected elsewhere. *She* is still an A-list actress getting million-dollar roles. If it worked, she wouldn't be.
We didn’t have cancel culture in my day. We had “being sent to Coventry”. Which was the same thing except, at least for me in Belfast, I didn’t know where Coventry was.
I loved what @stoolpresidente had to say, thought it was authentic and genuine. Real people love things that critics don't, they always have and always will. Cancel culture is real. Comedy is in danger. Wish we had the opportunity to have this conversation on more networks.

@IllCaesar I feel like I was criticizing the backlash to cancel culture though? I dunno it's possible my arguments were unclear or even just bad
I defended Contrapoints against the cancel culture crowd. Their response? To cancel her further. These people are entirely unreasonable.  https://t.co/O6wEXkQYIq
This isn’t an indictment about “cancel culture,” either. I don’t care about that.  But when you’re done canceling someone, if nothing has changed, what have you actually accomplished?
Check out critic ratings vs. fan ratings for AOC’s election documentary &amp; Dave Chappelle’s most recent comedy special. It’s Twitter’s funhouse mirror of absurdity on full display. The woke/cancel culture is totally made up by a handful of critics and far left wingers.  https://t.co/IqGbWGoHgv

I'm not big fan on cancel culture as a general rule, but between defending Woody Allen (?!?) and getting angry about not being able to play a trans person in a movie, I might make an exception for ScarJo.
@Juanfjco @mateogarciajax @MatPatGT Yes they absolutely bullied him... and it canceled his life cause they pushed him to hard. But you are zooming out so broadly, your missing the point. Those bullies were assholes. Cancel culture is an important psychological distinction - where people think they are doing GOOD.

Y'all don't even get amped about the actual threats to civil liberties that's why I'm so annoyed LOL I'm openly ridiculing anyone who complains about cancel culture &amp; isn't actually doing anything to challenge oppression.

I'm surprised that no one pointed this out about Chappelle's special:  1. He took a hard, firm stance against Cancel Culture. 2. He told people where he lives (which isn't common for famous people). 3. He told us, in excruciating detail, that he has a gun and knows how to use it.

It was never about cancel culture. How dare you use Erika’s death for your bullshit agenda. This is vile. Shame on you, @MatPatGT.
@PG_ESAM Or like the Smash girl with the racist screenshots!  Tons of ppl going "omg I'm so angry at her" = outrage culture  The ppl going "unfollow her, I'm glad her account is gone, dont ever talk to her" = cancel culture  It's problematic to associate accountability with vindication.
@MatPatGT dude, there's something to be said about cancel culture, but this is absolutely the fuck not it and I doubt you'll actually get what's legitimately harmful and instead resort to "my friends are all called bad people."
@Speedkicks The only times I ever see this actually do anything is women/PoC getting bullied for being in a show/movie and angry nerds not liking their character  Which is NOT what people who complain about "cancel culture" are worried about
@PG_ESAM I believe cancel culture is supposed to refer to the vindictive part of outrage culture that would like to see lives destroyed over the point of outrage more so than the point of outrage itself.
I'm really tired of seeing the phrase cancel culture  Cᴀɴᴄᴇʟ ᴄᴜʟᴛᴜʀᴇ ʙᴀʀᴇʟʏ ᴇxɪsᴛs  Outrage culture, sure, but cancelling someone is different than being mad at them  Holding someone accountable for their actions isn't cancelling
Here's another way to stop cancel culture.  Keep up the pressure on @BloombergBNA/@BLaw,...and their laughable hack of a #FakeNews reporter @benjaminpenn.   We need to remove the incentive hacks like Ben Penn have to lie about others with the goal of getting them fired.

A super helpful and I'd bet hard to write perspective.   Hopefully people can understand - that "cancel culture"? It doesn't exist in the sense, no one is canceling out of the blue because of a simple tweet. Things, lives, are more complicated and messy than that. It all sucks.
@indi_gogh @CasinoNSHalifax Actually from what I was told they said a derogatory word for trans at a show. Trans women at the show came to them and told them it was offensive. They said they learned that using that word wasn’t ok and moved on. Cancel culture is juvenile.

@pepperraccoon Cancel culture would dictate 'fuck that guy, he's done. That's it'   But there's overwhelming evidence to support a genuine, long term attempt at rehab, change and now dedicating his life to help others in the situation he was in.   I find it hard to simply ignore those efforts.
@pepperraccoon I saw Sam Harris discuss this topic (somewhat).  Society seemingly allows for criminals to 'do their time' and show change/remorse via rehab, sentencing and efforts to change.   Crimes of a 'moral' nature where cancel culture &amp; judgement of peers becomes much trickier...

Some have questioned how I can write for them when I called them out previously, for misjudged and misguided behaviour. It’s simple: I do not agree with ‘cancel culture’.
Exactly. It's mystifying. Stand by your man.  Cancel culture requires two to tango - the people calling for cancellation and the people canceling. If Olson stepped aside for purely personal reasons, that's one thing. If the DOL tossed him overboard on this basis, that's dreadful.
@BlanksSlate There you go again w your "cancel culture" /s
@KendridKamonne I know myself, and I know my industry. Nobody gets "canceled" unless they do a crime, and there's even shots at redemption after that. "Cancel culture" is a lot of normie motherfuckers pretending to be persecuted for their tastes when really they're the majority demographic...

@BrandytheDoggo @jeremiahjw @johnbcrist i mentioned that i thought the video was good. Like i said, i don’t know all of the details. i shared a few thoughts on cancel culture and people getting help. For what it’s worth, i’m in Florida dealing with a hurricane.
#ThingsWeShouldCancel Cancel culture. We should cancel cancel culture. People should be allowed to like what they like and express their opinions without fear of social retribution that involves the loss of jobs and livelihoods.
Cancel culture is what we should cancel. Humans are extraordinary &amp; complex. Great ones are flawed. Humans aren’t diamonds where the less flawed you are, the more worth you have. The wisest sometimes have the deepest scars to teach us how to avoid them. #ThingsWeShouldCancel
Dave Chappelle's new Netflix special and the myth of cancel culture  https://t.co/pIUUH6G4z5
#ThingsWeShouldCancel  This whole “cancel culture” thing has gotten way out of hand. Canceling is lame, immature and suggests throwing people away fixes problems. It doesn’t .   That being said: Neera Tanden.
First it was whining about "callouts", now it's all about "cancel culture", and basically people are always going to keep finding new words for how they just hate any kind of accountability
Publishers need to learn to cache social media posts in stories, otherwise the meat of the story vanishes when cancel culture brings the brigades and the tweets get deleted, leaving holes in the story 🕳   https://t.co/pj7R4gHekG
Just played guest in an ep of the @chuskipop podcast with hosts Sweety &amp; Pappu! They’re A+ hosts &amp; all three of us were nervous, but had a fun convo abt cancel culture, female friendships, &amp; a bunch of things I went on about for longer than I should’ve. Episode out tmrw I think!
When I google “cancel culture” the “call out culture” Wikipedia entry pops up. I also want to know who decided that cancel culture and call out culture are the same/similar?  Who are we letting define these words that are used to shame and dismiss the least powerful?
This is such an important conversation on the dangers of cancel culture.   Holding people accountable for their actions IS valuable and necessary. Dragging, canceling and mob mentality ISN’T.
@GaryParrishCBS Agreed. It was fantastic. I think there’s a brewing rebellion in creative industries against the entire idea of cancel culture. This felt like an important step in that direction.
i find it fascinating that people are arguing over "cancel culture" when there's no set definition and people don't even seem to know where it comes from.  not having a set definition is a great way to ensure no one wins any argument since people have their own truth in mind.
Does anyone know where the term “cancel culture” even comes from?   Who coined it? Who gets to define it?   Or is it intentionally ambiguous so people can wield it against people whenever they want?
@eugenegu OMG so now it was a suicide attempt? You keep reaching and I have no idea why.  You coulda said "I’m hoping Hart recovers from this disastrous car accident. Having faith that he can fight through his major injuries" without finding a way to highkey blame "cancel culture" for it.
@AmirTalai Because social media bullies and proponents of cancel culture are afraid that this car crash will make the public realize what they have done to a man who is now seriously injured and is a human being, not a monster.
I'll take cancel culture for $500 Alex.  The answer: One billion dollars.  What is the net worth required to drag Beyoncé and Jay-Z?  https://t.co/k3Ixt8BMAh
@eugenegu bruh wtf. Cancel culture and "how we treat people" has absolutely nothing to do with this sad car wreck. Why would you even mention it.
@medusasden That totally makes sense... however that is no longer what cancel culture is, it has turned into a toxic breeding ground FILLED with bullying, if you don’t wanna support someone... absolutely I get that, but bullying them into extinction? Absolutely not
cancel culture is cancelled
Kevin Hart has really suffered so much. I’m hoping he recovers from this disastrous car accident. He’s a human being who stood up to cancel culture and survived. Having faith that he can fight through his major injuries and survive this as well. We have to treat people better.
@TheSilkiest well since you mentioned me  I think "recoverable person" is a weird way to categorize ppl. ppl are still humans, not scripted npcs.  my critique of cancel culture is that if everyone is honest w/ themselves, eventually everyone will become canceled.
People have no spine. They couldn't even keep him out a full game lmaoooo I'm laughing so I don't cry.  Cancel culture doesn't exist. And "mere accusations always ruins lives" is false.
I think if we all keep tweeting about it every day for the rest of time, we can eventually figure out if “cancel culture” is good or not
If you disagree with a stranger's opinion you are engaging in "cancel culture," which means you are so cancelled.
@Old_Man_Shadow2 The shit of it is they’re all screaming about evil feminist twitter mobs and cancel culture and how metoo is a conspiracy against men...but this is Quinn, the OG victim of a Twitter mob, the very mob which can’t wait to try to destroy her again for...talking about being abused
Define irony: rallying a Twitter mob to harass a woman off of Twitter (again) and cancel her because you’re so angry about Twitter mobs and cancel culture
Let your favs get checked, folks.   It's really not that hard.  It's not "Cancel culture" or whatever fake thing people come up with.
REMINDER: Holding people accountable for the toxic bullshit they do isn't "cancel culture," people.

@curtmercadante Not sure a 280-char response (even in multi-parts) will suffice. IMO the "cancel culture" phenomenon consists of two major aspects:  (1) emotion/rage and (2) only-partly knowledge-based judgements/comments. This is a dangerous combination 4 a world seeking understandng &amp; justice.
@Danny88503844 Oh this is even better.  Panel was about lefties being 1960s repubs, mischaracterising jokes, to weaponize them in cancel culture.  This bitch didnt even quote my joke right, and you all jumped on the screech train.  Thank you for proving us right. Amazing.
Because they DO very much identify with and support abusers. That much is clear. "Stop cancel culture" – is yet another shoddy veil over their sexism and bigotry. The really just want women (everyone) to stop speaking up about sexual assault.
Cancel culture is just dodgeball for celebrities.
@_heyyyLEX @Long_liv_Larry @reginaldmorton9 Not about cancelling. Cancel culture isn’t even real + we can’t cancel a billionaire.   Again, we can like Jay as an artist and question his intentions cuz they haven’t been looking great as of recent.

Powerful people have the luxuries of lawyers, NDAs, CEO friends, etc. Where they canceled people behind closed doors.  Funny how no one was denouncing a cancel culture then.
Cancel culture exists only in the sense of powerful abusive people using intimidation, money, and whisper networks to push out and silence victims.
A lot of folks problem with “cancel culture” is they do t want to admit the need the love warmth and care from people. Especially people they’ve been socialized to disregard or treat poorly and they aren’t emotionally aware to say it
@Rlynnd1 But what is your point about #cancelculture?

“Cancel culture” is cancelation without dialogue. It’s not cancel culture if those you’ve harmed invite you to the table for discussion and you decline. That’s not “cancel culture,” but an  avoidance of accountability. And for that; you deserve everything coming to you—plus tax.
Man that cancel culture celebrity hunting season's just droppin' EVERYBODY, huh?
@Daryl_DoesIt @marcbernardin Better and with a more researched and clever approach. Not the blunt force of “lol look at me I’m pooping on stage are you offended yet, jokes on you lol”. It doesn’t do fuck all to help the cancel culture situation. If you have a platform, do good.
@marcbernardin I agree with ALL of this. Some jokes in there were masterfully crafted but the whole thing felt juvenile and from an antiquated age of comedy. Dissecting cancel culture is not a bad thing, but sounding like a teenager trying to piss off their step-dad is not a great way to do it.
I think cancel culture has also gotten a lot worse since the election of Trump.
My weary take on cancel culture is that so far, the only people I’ve observed get “cancelled” and it actually result in material, social, professional, and public perception consequences are...(usually) black women.

You know who gets to bitch about cancel culture? Steve Bartman. That’s it.
"Cancel culture" and "outrage culture" are toxic until it's someone YOU wanna cancel, and something YOU'RE outraged about.
People keep saying to me, “if cancel culture was a thing we wouldn’t have Trump.”  We have Trump as a /reaction/ to cancel culture. He’s a symptom of it. He’s just immune to it because he has an audience and doesn’t give a fuck.

How do I cancel this "cancel" culture? You sound fucking dumb when you say it.
See this is the thing though, the people who act like this in response to the lightest criticism of a comedian I've been watching for two decades are just as soft as the "cancel culture" people they claim to be rallying against. You're mad because I simply shared an opinion
I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again. Pastors, condemn “cancel culture” all you want, but make sure you’re preaching boundaries and healthy relationship practices too  Telling folks to allow any &amp; all people access to them at all times in the name of grace is not Godly.
@middleinitialt lol that's my opinion though. And it's reflected what people in my mentions were saying. Damn near nobody who responded to my tweet actually said what made it funny; they said that it took on cancel culture. That was their argument when I said I didn't like it.
If you asked the public anonymously you would see that the majority of the puplic know the 2 accusers are lying. However our cancel culture and mob mentality will not let people think for themselves. Dave just has the courage to say what everyone is thinking.
@WhodesntRead I agree that he should be allowed to atone. Cancel culture is too severe for me. But there's something about the way the story is structured that makes me think there are elisions. As a person who metoo'd someone, believe me, it's a massive pain. Women don't do it over bad sex.
@CraigSJ He has become adept at poking cancel culture with a sharp stick and profiting from the toothless outrage.
The dialogue stays on "cancel culture," an honest to God waste of everyone's time, because people love to feel like they're onto something not everyone can handle. It's not profound. It doesn't speak to the times. Terrestrial radio shock jocks played the same game since the '80s.
@hydrothemc I don't think there's anything deeper to be seen on the special itself, at all. I said "like someone else's followers" because people in my mentions aren't defending it for being funny, but they're defending it because it's going against cancel culture, as if that makes it funny
@KURTspeeds I'm sure some folks just find it funny off the strength; but not the folks in my mentions today. Folks in my mentions are almost exclusively saying "but he's taking on cancel culture!," as if that's what makes a routine funny.
@KURTspeeds Dave Chappelle is a very smart comedian. His work usu holds up to critical analysis because of how well thought out it is. This one doesn't.  Point is that I think people think it's funny solely because he's combatting cancel culture. I just don't think it's funny on its own

Dave Chappelle Slams Michael Jackson Accusers and "Cancel Culture" in Netflix Special  https://t.co/wgOO6oYDfj via @thr
What is the word for the person who in trying to cancel “cancel culture” ends up self-cancelling themselves?
I think Chappelle has always represented the idea of fighting cancel culture. His show got protests and complaints back then, too. So to me, fighting cancel culture is a long-standing baseline/philosophy for him, vs. the basis for how funny a new special actually is.
@PeterJaysin_ I get it, Peter. But I think a lot of people are so happy that he's attacking cancel culture that they find the shit funny/satisfying *because* he's attacking cancel culture. There's a difference between that and something being funny on its own merit *despite* it being offensive
yes I'm a big believer in CANCEL culture  Chonks Absolute units Never doubt astrology Corgis Energy crystals (Oh) Lawd He Comin'
@WEKetchum Still going to need the name of the person who has been canceled that keeps making you say you're not a fan of cancel culture
This is how I feel. What is he saying about cancel culture that nobody else has said already? Is this the type of standup that we're missing out on from cancel culture? Because if so...I'm straight. And I'm not a fan of cancel culture myself lol
Oh man, this last joke by David Chappelle is so absolutely real - many on Twitter will laugh without even realizing how much they do it themselves... It’s time to Cancel Cancel Culture  https://t.co/ZKJ92XJxiC 🌵 Click to do your part    https://t.co/DwQWHs3O0I
Of course, Art is subjective. But I feel like some of y'all are so excited that Dave's fighting against "political correctness"/"cancel culture" that y'all are gassing him up just bc of that, instead of watching critically. Reminds me of someone else's followers, but I'm sleep

The opposite of cancel culture is subscription culture. Subscribe to my blog about different ways to boil water you COWARDS!
And the whole cancel culture thing is so disingenuous. None of those celebrities have their careers ruined. At the most they're out the limelight for a few months/years. But of course it's easy to talk about a violent mob than the idea that words/actions can have consequences.
The day you listen to any opinion about @DaveChappelle’s comedy other than ‘he’s a legend of the craft’, is the day you should #CancelCulture yourself out of existence.
@314_Great1 Bruh he was fearless. It was like he stopped caring about the consequences of cancel culture which is dope
Let me clue you kids in on something you might not have put together yet:  Two things, shame and cancel culture, only work if you actually GIVE A SHIT about them.
Dave Chappelle talks cancel culture and more in his new @Netflix special #SticksandStones   “Michael Jackson’s been dead for 10 years, and this n***a’s got two new cases.”   https://t.co/1K5ai4Dbje  https://t.co/QZ6z13MlL3
I'm often reminded of what society has become with social media. Like any tool, it can also be misused.... especially with outrage culture.  Dave Chappelle uses comedy to show how cancel culture appears to him.  https://t.co/Lf3Zf4EzxQ

Amazing correlation between comedians railing against cancel culture and comedians being washed.
I definitely recommend Chappelle's new special. Totally worth the watch. It's all about cancel culture. (thanks @csgodevil.)  Bonus: VICE hates it.  https://t.co/4MhSx6NgDL
If you think there's a problem with "cancel culture," it's more than likely the case that you just have a friend who was caught saying something racist or being abusive because literally no one has ever been "cancelled." I don't even know what that means.
@Josh_McClorey I mean we are both talking on the same side about cancel culture but we agree on lots I think.
Precisely this. Cancel culture basically says ‘people never deserve a second chance, or redemption’. It’s lock away and throw the key. Seems a bit medieval and to ignore the human capacity for change and - that most Hamilton of words - forgiveness.
Cancel culture is not just a left wing thing. It’s left and right and mainly stupid.
Cancel culture is a crime against forgiveness. It strips people of the right to change, assuming their past will be their future. Fuck it all
@SamSacks @RaniaKhalek Nah, dog. You don't get to act like shit-talking us without tagging was some act of kindness. The fact that you said anything for your followers—and in what I believe was bad faith—is the issue.  And now, here's a column on "made up" cancel culture:   https://t.co/ecW4r3uZgw
The idea that @olivegarden is supporting @realDonaldTrump's reelection is as fake and hard to swallow as its creamy mushroom ravioli. And the #BoycottOliveGarden movement is a sign of what's wrong with today's cancel culture. My latest at @reason  https://t.co/0RTde7hTYc
@RaniaKhalek @kgosztola I'd love it if either of you could give me one example of someone who was a victim of "cancel culture" and what that meant.
@SamSacks @kgosztola Cancel culture isn’t made up. I used to participate in it and I’ve been the target of it. Your moralizing and finger wagging is incredibly condescending. If you don’t want to hear Jamie then don’t listen to the episode, it’s that easy.
Dave Chappelle’s new Netflix special is sooo good on cancel culture and wokeness. Soooo good
@RaniaKhalek @kgosztola I think the characterization is accurate, and I'm sorry that you're personally offended by it, but it was a really poor decision to have Jamie Kilstein on your show to discuss a made up phenomenon like "cancel culture" that only serves to advance reactionary interests.
@LevineJonathan @hamiltonnolan While I think it’s silly to matter of factly state that this right wing pantomime of left wing cancel culture is bad faith because it’s right wing (and not just bad faith) ... I also think every #seriousjourno should read this graf  https://t.co/qOFtPf22a9
Is @ShawnMendes a racist?   Clearly not, but that hasn’t stopped a woke mob for coming for him over old ‘racist’ tweets. Just more proof cancel culture has gone too far.    https://t.co/RssB1rQqzE

Cowen reminds us that boycotts are most likely to succeed when directed toward "declining companies with good reputations." I wonder whether these lessons re: boycotts can be applied in any form to broader cancel culture-type stuff––boycotting/canceling people/public figures.

Queer communities are prone to call-out and “cancel” culture because of our collective history of trauma and abuse. But @razorfemme argues that changing how we react to one another is intrinsic to our survival  https://t.co/cuRr5n2vuC
The problem is cancel culture in general. We don’t cancel people. We call them in, not out.

fully up to you, but I think the impulsivity of cancel culture can be dangerous. I understand being shocked that a public figure would publicly support the police in Hong Kong given what we’ve seen and know but  #BoycottMulan

@VitalikButerin @zooko @robertwiblin This Internet is based on the conception that we can all communicate, because we can't hurt eachother. You can always just walk away from the keyboard, type /ignore, click block.  Which get ported to the real world, as ghosting, as cancel culture.  It's, as they say, problematic.

@Circuitts @theshreenation @Its_Colt_ @Oxford_Rosie @brookehouts Have fun with your cancel culture. If you need hate so much...  But I can tell you: Empathy is the only intelligent option. What can help the dog? Why did she abuse the dog? What can we do against it? What can help her? What can we learn from this?  Thats the key.
Hehe “cancel” culture is so funny. Especially these younger millennials who can’t even cancel Netflix but think they can cancel a human. #bye

Cancel culture kills it's own.
Although Silverman neither named the film nor offered any details, she spoke in-depth about "cancel culture":  https://t.co/NUdpGd8K77
She’s right on about cancel culture. The only point I’d disagree with is that it’s “the Left” engaging in it. The Right has its own versions of cancel culture as well.

@Gothalion Yea we share the same stance on cancel culture for sure. I fucking hate it. Alinity needs to be banned and ninjas channel has to be taken down for good. We’ll see.
@WishYaLuckk I think these instances are the extreme minority of impact that twitch has. Twitch has a lot to fix. Every platform does. My point is cancel culture just kicks the can down the street

I don’t know if I’ve ever called for someone to be “cancelled.” It’s not really how I reckon with fucked-up-shit. Anyway, pointing out something true but inconvenient for your perception of one of your faves is not “cancel culture.” It’s called critical thinking, ya dweebs.

.@Andy says he is "tired of boycott culture and cancel culture," so he won't stop going to @soulcycle and @Equinox... which is just another way for a wealthy white guy to say that he does not give a shit about vulnerable people, when it comes down to it.
Will be interesting to see if Twitter outrage mob reacts to this like they did to finding out Stephen Ross owns SoulCycle. I doubt they will, but it just goes to show how arbitrary Cancel Culture is.

If you’re at one of these sponsors caught up in an attempt to cancel someone, you need to realise most people contacting you didn’t see the thing they’re complaining about. Ask them how often they watch the show your sponsor and what other shows they watch. #CancelCulture
@TheOnlyDZ I also deleted the original tweet because the last bit brought up really negative emotions for me, and watching the video back got me sad. I still stand by what I said. Cancel culture is awful and people bandwagon hate. Everyone makes mistakes, influencers get judged the most tho
Apparently there’s some YouTuber who posted a video of her abusing her dog and while I’m not down with cancel culture in general that is some ninth circle of Hell shit.

Cancel culture has gone too far
@DwgpndSurf Because we live in the ALL or NOTHING culture, cancel culture. “IF YOU DON’T AGREE WITH ME, FUCK YOU” culture. No forgiveness, no empathy for one another.
See why I keep saying people on here just jump on bandwagon and don’t care about the issues they want to cancel people for?   Today Phat Joe is ok because he is degrading someone they don’t like.   Ba sele! Cancel culture is rooted in bias.

Here’s why cancel culture sucks... you can’t cancel true enemies. Only the ignorant or misinformed.  Your enemies grow in strength and ranks. Never deliver troops to the other side.
Maybe we can make this a trend and replace #cancelculture with #conversationcivilization?  It’s more productive, fam! ✌️🎧🙌
I’d rather we take the effort we put into creating role models and help those we’ve scapegoated come back after they have been shamed, destroyed, discarded &amp; humiliated. We need to show the courage to reach out to those we have thrown away by our new ghastly ‘cancel culture’. 🙏

@tylertreese Exactly! This is the type of hollow cancel culture shit that these people revel in. It’s fake progressivism at its worst. They don’t really give a shit about mental health or LGBTQ+ people. They just want to use those issues to justify attacking people.
I know it’s Peak #CancelCulture but DON’T #CancelNYT. We need the paper’s excellent reporters to keep reporting facts, analysis and deep dives, but we can hold @nytimes accountable for when an editor softsteps a hardball issue. Lies are lies. Racism is racism. Call it what it is.
@ericbot And #CancelNYT isn't just about cancel culture, or whether the @nytimes is too far or not far enough left, or whether this was intentional or not. In a crisis of trust, something major and clear needs to be done to restore trust, the same way it does in govt/corporations.
@gmyerskt It's very easy to get sucked in, which is the other very prominent feature of Twitter. But yeah, the speed at which "cancel culture" is operating across the board these days is pretty alarming, in a broad sense.

and when it has been voiced it has been soundly mocked and scorned . @laripley @UnburntWitch @sarahkendzior and @carolinesinders  have put it in books and articles . We have slate articles.... compare that to how many "cancel culture is bad" tomes
Now look at how many have articles about civility, about toxic twitter, about cancel culture etc.  Hugo Schwizer alone has about 30 articles, maybe THREE mention me by name
@CalibreObscura Good lad. Don’t apologise, don’t back down. These cancel culture freaks will do anything to scream someone else down in their pursuit of looking virtuous for five minutes online. It’s predictable that he only had a problem with this when a massacre happened in the US too.

@misterpatches Cancel culture is a very complicated subject, but in this case the pre-release protest was partially motivated by actual trans extras from the film who were misled about what they were appearing in, and who faced transphobic comments from the crew.

@iThatBoyBrian cancel cancel culture !!!
for so many people and especially “fans” to collectively gather and participate in cancel culture is so disheartening. it leaves no room for the truth to come out and it’s counterproductive. the 2K community has done so well with rejoicing in each other’s success, don’t stop now.
@_Zeets I'm about to cancel culture you
@Mr_Jimbob @mallen_87 @TheSportSocial @91Marley I agree. And wish the same generosity would be extended to things people said years, or decades ago - even as adults. It happens everywhere...all the time. Current "cancel culture" is bullshit. As is the crazy double standards...offence is taken depending on who says it.

Cancel culture on Twitter is toxic and I beg everyone to do their due diligence in getting facts from all sides before attacking them on the internet.   Anyone with further questions is welcome to contact me through my Twitter DM.
People liked and shared the tweet without checking all the sides of the case. Therefore, spreading a rumor without considering the consequences. We’ve normalized and perpetuated the toxicity of the cancel culture, and i’ll admit that I’ve done the same in the past

@AuthorNinaPerez @CKeefeShea He apologised because he saw a small backlash. The cancel culture was coming for him.
Cancel culture is toxic. It’s juvenile. People can’t have an opinion unless your opinion matches whatever the trend is. All of this shit is trendy.
It is not cancel culture to explain to people the harm they may be doing unintentionally.   It is not cancel culture for trans people to respond to comments about us and share how it impacts us.   We hope @MarioLopezExtra's words lead to much-needed dialogue. ❤️  #WednesdayWisdom

Cancel culture is fucking gross. He didn’t even say anything wrong! 3 year olds have no idea about their sexual identity! And news flash, some people lie, so we shouldn’t just “believe” anyone. We should investigate the accused and prove innocence or guilt.

@KEEMSTAR Cancel culture is a myth. The best way to get cancelled is to stop uploading or start uploading crap content.
"Ending legalism is not the same thing as sanctioning sin...." It's a pipe dream, but perhaps this logic could be applied to efforts to turn abortion into a crime. So much more could be accomplished by argument and moral suasion. #cancelculture
Hit the nail on the head here. Be underdog and succeed. Succeed and then be hated. Repeat. Could the album have been condensed a little? Sure, same can be said about basically every album over 45 mins. But it’s a good album, and doesn’t deserve the hate. “Cancel” culture is toxic
When did "cancel" culture begin? Millennials? Gen Z? Post-Gen Z youths? Humans mess up and the internet (esp Twitter/IG) has become this place where people viciously call out &amp; "cancel" others. Is this healthy? What are your thoughts?

Writers - we can admire the current successful class of writer/show runners and still wish they were doing more for mid/lower level writers during this very weird time.  I don’t believe in cancel culture. It’s toxic. It’s OK to acknowledge people you admire don’t always look back

This is a joke. Cancel culture is trash.

Also, no one thinks they are part of cancel culture so rest assured this tweet is not about you
So much of “cancel culture” feels like the reverse of “I liked this band before they were popular.” Like, “I knew the person you admired was TRASH before you did!!! HAHAHA U DUMMY!” Good for you, I hope you can one day achieve maximum coolness. I’m rooting for you buddy
@BuzzHawley THANK you. And I know that you would call it out if you did. That was my point, that the cancel culture comes for everyone now, it seems.
basically, the "dirtbag" solution of "haha fuck sensitive weaklings" is not a workable solution, because it brushes a lot of people's genuine concerns aside  also "hahaha fuck sensitive weaklings" is another form of the supposed "cancel culture" as "weaklings" are pointed out

And the way that cancel culture has been specifically infantalized especially within tech culture and writing is directly anti black as hell and it sucks its permeating down because it’s making a comedy of allowing folks to tell you no
And straight up cancel culture via white tech and culture users is a very different beast , and I’m annoyed that’s its permeating down , because it’s the beginning of late millennial brand shift that I’m not a fan of
And all direct confrontation is turning into cancel culture, because most PR comms management is the delete or the non answer . So Cancel culture also has a side of ... you ended the discussion so I withdrew my energies/resources
One of the large problems about “cancel culture” is it’s been racialized as black, appropriated and then discussed as if it’s universal when it’s not . And Amara is right it’s exhausting. Because the easiest way to stop “cancel culture “ discussions is to ask folks to define it

@polotek i dont understand why call outs and cancel culture are a good idea. You would never treat a child or a coworker like that when they made a mistake, why it is Ok in other interactions?
“Cancel Culture” almost always arises when someone *isn’t* from their mistakes. I’ve never seen someone who sincerely and meaningfully apologized for a harm get cancelled, but I have seen people get cancelled when they need a backhoe to dig themselves any deeper.

I don’t support cancel culture because it is inherently rooted in relationship bias.   You more likely to cancel someone you don’t like or know. At its core CC is not about the issue but the person.   2 people can do or say the same thing but only 1 be “cancelled”
Cancel culture doesn’t cleanse people, it cleans social media timelines.
@cillianhbates Thanks for speaking up! If I talk about Cancel Culture again I'll try to remember to specify which part of it I'm picking at. (And please, if you happen to see me speaking out in a way that's unclear or possibly damaging, I appreciate your feedback!)
@cillianhbates I agree that what I said was probably too nuanced to be stuffed into one tweet. It's the "culture" part of "cancel culture" that I feel is damaging. The bandwagon "coolness" of taking any single slip-up and dragging it out into a spotlight like a stoning, celebrated in public.

People also feel that public figures have no right to privacy. Within the “cancel culture”, people launch full on investigations into the online footprint of an influencer digging for anything they can find, in order to paint a narrative that will get the most clicks...
Part of this relates to “call outs” and “cancel culture” I don’t believe in “canceling” or silencing people you disagree with.  But I also think that reckless ppl with large followings, especially young audiences, are not above public criticism as public figures.

Thread on why cancel culture doesn't exist and how it's used to broadly dismiss and gaslight the marginalized seeking accountability...or just speaking their truths.
But ultimately the realness is that because you read cancel culture as “black” you think you get to be god damn lazy . And the fact you’re black doesn’t make it OKAY
Wanna talk “cancel culture” bet : Culture has aesthetics, semantics, semiotics, seminal moments , etc. Talk Cancel culture ? Okay GO
Also I’m tired of these shallow ass readings of “cancel culture” that a) show you only read white writers and b ) are so god damn lazy about culture
People who start talking about “cancel culture” when conversations about accountability and context are happening, especially discussions that include (and should be led by) those who have been harmed or silenced, are the people I want to cancel.

This is also a suboptimal case for taking a stand on cancel culture and forgiving the mistakes of teenagers. As one of my colleagues tweeted, “College admissions is going to get even weirder if 17 year old applicants start asking not to be judged on their behavior at 16.”
My position on cancel culture is simple -- and these principles should apply to left and right:  1) Constitutional rights should be defended, always.  2) Private reprisals for apologized-for past statements should be rare.  3) There should be greater grace for kids.

@NarciSickboy It's hard. In a world with closed-minded executives, reductive and limiting views of queer talent and toxic cancel culture it can seem impossible. I get around this by ensuring that I'm always working on at least one thing that is 100% my creation. No commissioner, no brand etc.

cancel culture is absolutely pernicious and the enemy of creativity, whether it comes from the left or the right. @FatWhiteFamily uniquely seem to be caught in a pincer movement between the two, which suggests to me they must be doing something right.
@HardlySane117 Ridiculous ban you ate at the purple place. Well said with your parting statement, though. Cancel culture is way out of control.  There are far better gaming forums out there to call home, y'know.

@space_cowboy32 That’s not the point. I do not, repeat DO NOT want to contribute to cancel culture. I love Vanjie, and don’t think she was using the word to be hateful. I just have a lot of feelings about it. They’re complicated, because there are many layers.
@the_moviebob @SuperSpacedad @JCWintheflesh @ashleylynch It's not about "bad jokes" and "cancel culture", Frost's consistently stated ideology is bad and the reasons she alienates people are really fucking obvious  It's not even in the same ballpark as people dragging Natalie for irony poisoned shitposts
@mssilverstein "Cancel culture" is defined as the rabid intolerance of people on the left. That's possible because instances of right intolerance are ignored and presented as irrelevant to a discussion about free speech, I think.
@mssilverstein I think defining cancel culture so it doesn't include right wing terrorism is bad!
Like, you think after my experience at Harlot Media (which was unfairly hounded out of existence) and my relationship with Chloe Sagal (RIP) that I have any patience with horseshit cancel culture then come at me and get blocked and forgotten. I don't need you.

@jamescharles I said this to you when we met and before everything blew up, but you’ve done a competent job addressing all the issues of late. Cancel culture sucks but I think you might lead a turn around on it. Keep growing, learning, stay grounded and you’ll be rewarded by your followers ❤️
@YESEEGHOSTS The cancel culture is lamer than ANY of the really dumb movements/groups.. this includes the Klan, people who put fruit in mac n cheese and Red Sox fans.

@mskirasparkles Yeah once people have the "power" to feel like they're canceling people they start acting like EVERY person needs to be treated with zero tolerance policies. But cancel culture isn't real and no one really gets canceled. So I don't worry about it too much.
Lots of cancel culture drama right now about Tyson's tacos in Austin and the owner being a "Trumpy shitbag" as many-a-internet-commenter claims. Everyone knows Rosita's and Discada are better, not sure who ate at Tyson's anyway.   But also, cancel culture is deeply dumb.
Just had to explain what cancel culture, pizza gate and milkshake duck is to the same person it’s sometimes sobering to realise that most people are not sweaty dweebs who live on the internet

Thank you for articulating part of my problem with the term "cancel culture" it erases the power dynamics, such is vital context
@scareaphina Honestly, i think just being specific about the situation is the best. I think “cancel culture” has become such an umbrella term that it’s so vague and i think that’s part of the problem and how it got weaponized to dismiss people making legit boundaries.
@scareaphina So I def think that ostracizinf people does cause harm. But the term cancel culture feels very politicized in a way that feels more mocking and like backlash. Sorta like how "triggered" has been misappropriated for minimization
@scareaphina How do you define canceled? Bc if you mean by getting ostracized, I've experienced that too because I outed my abuser.  But victims have been getting ostracized forever. The term cancel culture didn't appear until POC, survivors started getting heard a tiny bit more
@scareaphina Tbh I don't think cancel culture actually exists. I think it's backlash against normally disempowered people setting boundaries and calling people out.  Like, do people ever actually get "canceled"? I haven't seen it but I know I'm just one person.

@Calfreezy @ImAllexx Cancel Culture doesn't exist. The only way one truly gets 'cancelled' is if they stop uploading content, their content becomes stale or they switch channel direction.
I'm saying all this as someone who despises "cancel culture" — but also thinks it's a symptom. It's what happens when our interactions are mediated by the internet AND when people are tired and pissed off.   And some of us have more reason to be pissed off than others.

Engaging with drama is not good for your mental health. If you see it, avoid it, don’t get involved with other peoples’ drama and walk away. I wish “uplift culture” could top “cancel culture”... but here we are.
Historically - people who share your level of influence and features have done WORSE and straight up THRIVED afterwards lmfao like its fucking CRAZY.  But the people have had enough.  And though Cancel Culture is now out of fucking control, a dialogue should still happen. (16/25)
@jamescharles The moment I watched Tati's video I instantly went on the slander train against you which is contributing to the toxic cancel culture and for that I apologize. What's more is though I felt my words wise, i've reached out to you via DM hoping to help you think.(1/25)
Can we cancel “cancel culture”. The irony.
Cancel culture has to stop. @JamesCharles is human like the rest of us, only his mistakes are public with millions literally weighing in on an issue that has nothing to do with them. Remember that regardless of follower count, there’s a real person reading it on the other end.
Cancel culture needs to be canceled. Everybody seems to be guilty until proven otherwise. Let’s take time with things.
i dont tweet a lot because most of the time im scared of the internet. BUT this whole ‘cancel culture’ thing is extremely dangerous &amp; ridiculous. stop being little dick heads &amp; be nice. stop giving into the theatrics of ‘cancelling’ somone. our planets dying. focus on that. bye x
@LynnieNoquez I feel the same way. I even get sucked into commenting about stuff. Hopefully the tide changes and something else becomes popular besides cancel culture.
I would like to take the time to give a massive 🖕🖕🖕 to the people that were condescending in their responses to this tweet. There is ALWAYS three sides to every story. This “cancel culture” is fucked up and needs to stop. Check your idols before they control your opinions
this whole “cancel culture” era is hella annoying to me honestly

I think the important thing we need to take away from the James and Tati drama is that social media is not a place to address private issues, and that “cancel culture” is toxic.
But also, these beauty gurus are ppl I watch regularly. We see their lives, care about their opinions, &amp; so it's no wonder we are captivated by the drama. It humanizes them. Even with receipts, experiences are personal. I say cancel culture is cancelled.

If you get the chance go back and watch my video about cancel culture.  We talk a lot about seeing the recpeits and second chances and it's more true today than it was the day I posted it.  Hope this turns into a lesson for all of us about cancel culture.
. I’d like to take a moment to refer back to our first video about @jamescharles when we asked you to wait for the facts &amp; let this play out. Cancel culture needs to stop. We are better than the hate spewed across the Internet. YouTube is a place for creation &amp;
I feel so bad for @jamescharles the Internet is a savage place, where people are happy to try and destroy someone’s career without proof.   Cancel culture needs to end before it ends up taking someone’s life 💖
did james charles just cancel cancel culture
It's not that I don't believe in forgiveness because I definitely do, but it's telling that James Charles can be uncanceled, by some people so easily. Cancel culture is silly. Let's stop pretending.
Dude @jamescharles was innocent, I can't believe that so many people got manipulated by that.   This proves that people's mob mentality and cancel culture needs to change.  Even tho I said nothing publicly on the matter I feel so sorry for James dude, he got so much hate...
Upon another read this piece, it is even less coherent. The examples he cites aren’t millennials. The tweet he cites is by someone living in NORTHERN IRELAND and is hardly an example of overheated cancel culture. An editing process that included factchecking would help.

you only have to look at the last week's situation with james charles to see how quickly cancel culture can turn against you (and not that i'm saying he is) but even when you are trying to be honest and make an honest statement or apology, it can backfire.
i know a lot of bloggers don't have the strength to speak up about something they are not trained or fully understood in, with the large worry of going 'viral' or the terrifying notion of 'cancel culture' hanging in the balance should they get it wrong or make an honest mistake

Cancel culture is never helpful. It doesn’t matter who it is or what they’ve done, it’s not productive and it’s not healthy. Either give constructive criticism or unfollow/block them. Dragging people for sport is the most toxic part of social media and we need to stop fuelling it

Is “cancel culture” here to stay ??
Point of today's video is simple.    Cancel culture is a great weapon to be used against truly awful people.  But it needs to be a scalpel, and not a club.  We have to wield it efficiently and effectively against the RIGHT people.  End of opinion.
I clearly say this in the video, several times, because I know people can be idiots.  But its not stopping people from being idiots, I'm afraid.  The point of the video is to say cancel culture is a great weapon against such things. but needs to be wielded with efficiency.
This is live:  I'm willing to listen and learn if I am wrong but I do not believe that I am wrong.  I think cancel culture has its uses, but at the rate its going we'll have canceled every single creator by the end of the year.  We need to use it carefully  https://t.co/zCzEsKLkeh

@MizMisse Agree. 1st it was that creepy projared who I don’t feel bad for at alllll &amp; then James. I’m not really into cancel culture because we all F up &amp; do stupid things, especially at his age but he handled it badly &amp; if u aren’t humble, life will humble you-so lesson learned hopefully
@violetsromanoff I really really really didn’t wanna say a word because I hate cancel culture so like James honey if u see this I meant no harm I just couldn’t resist I’m awful
@itsjohnsteel @jamescharles 100% 💖💖💖 That’s exactly why this whole cancel culture is stupid. What happened to boycotting and peaceful protest? Lol
Fuck this James Charles drama is STAGGERING - deserved or not, "cancel culture" is extraordinary- I can't help but feel concern for a 19 y/o to now be on the receiving end of abuse from millions of people who up until recently hero-worshiped the guy to the level of fame he was at

@summersilvery Yeah, you’re not wrong.  The compounded problem is “heard mentality”, a lot of these people who judge without context have either attracted like minded ppl , or infected others...  It’s why cancel culture and outrage is so problematic, independent thought is hard to come by.
@Darker4Serenity Cancel culture gets to the point where minor things get blown out of proportion. Fewer bans, AND more transparency of the reason for bans. That's what I'd like to see.

Reporting on efforts by censorious art students to get Camille Paglia fired once again revealed to me the alarming number of professors who censor themselves because they fear callout and cancel culture.   It is epidemic.  https://t.co/h75V5xhJ5x
You can think cancel culture is a good thing—by all means, make that argument if you want—but you don’t get to change the definition of censorship, to make it narrower, so that you can claim you’re not making a pro-censorship argument.
People who think censorship can only be done by the state need to relook at the definition of censorship. Yes, the most egregious version of censorship is state censorship, but censorship comes in many forms, and cancel culture clearly falls under this umbrella term.  https://t.co/ZINHNRh4Cn
I won't even pick out quotes since practically every answer is quotable, but it is to "cancel culture" what a red flag is to a bull.
ultimately, the argument could easily be "cancel culture is bad" because this imaginary thing that we are indulging due to the overarching system's need to reproduce itself on even the smallest of levels... hurts me  but I think that directs us into the realm of individualism
what folks call "cancel culture" is a product of these things; it *can* be genuine, but in a world in which the norms of the market have been thoroughly forced onto every part of our life, it is always transactional  that doesn't mean the individual doing it intends this
also I would like to address the whole cancel culture thing:  as I said in my videos a while back, "callout culture" (and therefore "cancel culture") are misleading terms. it's not culture, and I think this framing device does a disservice to the argument
@EdenAlexScott cancel culture
@RhetoricAndThis @camillerankine Exactly. It all depends on the context and the nuance. But cancel culture isn't about context or nuance. It's like the red scare. What it wants to do is shut down dialogue.
@RhetoricAndThis @camillerankine I agree. It's one reason I find cancel culture troubling. I find writers having to apologize for writing characters troubling. I don't want anyone to apologize to me for how I found the gay male characters in A Little Life. But I am free to critique that representation.
@alexdimitrov Well i think this idea of “cancel culture,” though I don’t agree with the term, is in direct relationship to a culture in which the marginalized are always marginalized and no one ever apologies. I’m suggesting that one cannot look at it without too looking at how power divides.
@RhetoricAndThis I don’t know that but what I am trying to think through and vocalize in this thread has to do with cancel culture at large, its problems and overall moralism

@PalmMuteAudio Cancel Culture is a buzzword used to demonize holding people accountable when they hurt others or normalize hurtful behavior. Yknow, accountability. A good thing.  Yes, this can be weaponized in bad faith (see: Mike Cernovitch) but that doesn’t invalidate the entire concept.
@PalmMuteAudio At no point did I say anything about “cancelling” anyone, nor did I imply it. I choose not to support people who casually use hate speech for fun, and I encourage everyone to do the same.  If that’s Cancel Culture then I don’t give a shit, call it whatever you want.

People who use the term "cancel culture" need to mind their business. If I "cancel" someone, it's a personal choice. If enough people make that personal choice, someone is "cancelled," I suppose.   You can still single-handedly support them if you wish. 🤷🏾‍♂️

I hate cancel culture omg it's like yes, i want the world to get better, but no, I  absolutely DO NOT want to BE there for it
all i have to say is this cancel culture is out of control
People complain about “cancel culture,” but many once beloved celebrities simply reveal their own irrelevance by way of their staggering ignorance and condescension. What is there to cancel.
Is "cancel culture" a real thing? Or is it just a myth? Besides Roseanne and Megyn Kelly, I can't think of too many celebrities that were actually "canceled" because of online heat. Is there another celeb who lost his or her career just because of social media?

@YuliianaK That was a misstep on her but I think you're wrong that it'd be ok if she didn't brag. The minute the video came out people were trying to cancel her, hence why she made that video. People aren't forgiving in "cancel culture" and sometimes that tenacity is warranted. Not now.
cancel culture is trash..if all it takes is a little dirt or fake news to cancel someone..then everybody &amp; they mama need to be “canceled.”

Agree. I've been calling cancel culture dumb and hypocritical for a minute. Just stick to these three rules:  a) A listen to whomever you want.   b) Do no judge others for whom they decide to listen to.  c) Don't make excuses when you faves do shady stuff.   DASSIT

@thisisNOVEMBER Right, and the author doesn't tell you how to feel about it. Cancel culture, specific to someone's apparent ignorance, is antithetical to achieving greater social awareness so that this behavior doesn't repeat itself. There are others like DC, who share similar views.

We’ve got more articles about “cancel culture “ and allowing free speech to Nazis than about #yourslipisshowing or the connections of known racists to the highest levela of tech and government.
Don’t be fooled these people love “cancel culture” because if they didn’t have it they would have to talk consequences
Also Cancel Culture debate looks especially ducking frivolous when we look at which cultures are actually producing violent events and BODY COUNTS
He likes hemming and hawing because Cancel culture is a more beneficial representation than when he’s fact checked it’s questionable and he openly solicits biased sources and folks approve of it
Cancel culture is the epistolary embodiment of folks being frightened that marginalized ( mostly black and queer ) have decision making force equal to their cultural influence
Like name a cancel culture aesthetic? Name something that’s not a gif or a statement?
Cancel culture has no aesthetics , no codification, no permanent phenomenology or even ephemera of diverse opinions.
“Cancel Culture” is them hanging their hurt fees on vernacular phraseology
The biggest irritant about “cancel culture” is that people who hate it spend a lot of time complaining about free thinking while their ultimate goal is to tell people what to do
And that , that magical formula only works for white girls , and the critiques of cancel culture , call out culture , poor management of Twitter mentions has a lot to do with how BW got left hung out to  dry

it genuinely needs to be said that "fuck cancel culture" has ALWAYS been a dogwhistle for "shut the fuck up SJWs." I was on tumblr when it became a thing and, like, that's precisely what it is. nothing's perfect but we don't have any alternatives.

Imagine my disappointment when I learned that “cancel culture” was not actually a movement to cancel culture.
Hell yes I’m into Cancel Culture.  I cancel plans all the time, and it would be nice to feel less guilt about it.
@spiritualsugar @jonathantripp @shanedawson It’s important conversation. I’m looking at a lot of the shift in internet culture. The cancel culture stuff, para-social relationships creating entitlement, media’s negative bias towards YouTubers, the trepidation of advertisers...  It’s a lot of cooks in the kitchen...
Meanwhile "cancel culture" isn't particularly toxic. The people who are most invested in denying marginalized people the right to set boundaries definitely are though. You might want to interrogate why you are more invested in the comfort &amp; education of villains than victims.
"Cancel culture is toxic" continues to be an argument that hinges on an idea that some people are owed the money/ time  /energy/forgiveness of those that they have hurt. Being canceled = some people (usually Black women and femmes) have withdrawn their support. Dassit.
It just bothers me because black men rarely have this energy for black women. Why does the cape always get to flapping when it’s not us?  Also, yeah, cancel culture is toxic but you know what else is? Writing off constructive criticism as “being mean.”   https://t.co/CmXner9ui4
@shanedawson lmao bro I’m sorrry you even have to apologize for stupid shit from your past.  We live in a time where people dig up whatever they can and it’s honestly ridiculous... you apparently can’t be have a past, be a more immature version of yourself. Cancel culture is hot.

What the world needs now is quite literally the opposite of cancel culture.  Take everything you hear with a grain of salt.  Forgive.    Teach those who screw up.   Give them a chance to learn. To grow.  Let them be shining beacons of how and why we should all seek to improve.
Hot take:  Cancel culture is bullshit.  You people are idiots.    Save your out rage for shit that actually matters.    Not jokes. Not clips taken out of context.  Not far reaches of logic.  But the real in your face monsters who fuck you over and dont give a shit about you.

To hell with ‘Cancel Culture.’ America never canceled the art, music, films, poetry, and creative works of flawed white people who raped, assaulted, murdered, stole, were bigots, on drugs, or just bad people.   But it wants to erase the lives, legacies, and works of Black people.

It actually really really surprises me that people are surprised he got "canceled"  Is this supposed to be some new height in the minutiae of SJW cancel culture? That doing a romance between two foreigners using a historical atrocity as a "backdrop" is tasteless?

Cancel culture is toxic. Gives too much room for weird agendas and shit. And that’s that on that.
What do you do when your favorite artist or creator becomes more than a problematic fave? When cancel culture drops judgment, should you follow suit?  We asked three writers with three very different opinions to weigh in.  https://t.co/KKgApgQiKE

I hate #CancelCulture. I hope it gets cancelled.
@_ElizabethMay @chel_c_cam I've had a couple of teens DM me (at other times) to say they feel unsafe to speak up and give their opinions because the community is so unforgiving of people who get things wrong.   And like, I get cancel culture for genuinely terrible adults but we shouldn't be scaring teens.
but I’m sure we’re all looking forward to another column/more airtime on how “cancel culture” and “political correctness” are the real threats to our vibrant democracy
@TheAuracl3 @BrothaDom I think what fella is trying to say is, if you show any growth or genuine remorse then cancel culture is likely to swallow you, but if you do a trump you'll be fine

All I'm saying is "cancel culture" was birthed from Black Twitter as something counter-hegemonic. It's been well and truly appropriated by general twitter as a term spawning from mob culture, making it about as hegemonic as it gets. Anyway... Enough with that bee in my bonnet.

@Kryptomovies77 So? I can agree to all that and still find it distasteful that people are trying to turn it into a cause. I don't like "cancel" culture, either. Doesn't give people license to make up stories about Rotten Tomatoes, when the site itself shows differently.

Subscription culture led us to cancel culture. We've been putting our culture on layaway. Everything was way better when we just stole music and dubbed tapes.  When people tried to cancel NWA they had to physically buy copies of the record to burn them. That's commitment.

People bring up money, and I think that’s interesting but not really why cancel culture is a thing. For instance, all my MJ records are used, bought at secondhand shops. But I still have this question of whether it’s okay to play them or own them.
I want to get past this binary debate about whether cancel culture is good or bad, and look at why people feel the need to resort to it, and what it would take to  make people feel they have to do things like throw out MJ records.  https://t.co/9J8UgsE0eD

I've been pressed on Cancel Culture on 2 podcasts and a poker game in the last week. It's a fascinating, extremely complex, and very misunderstood phenomenon. I think I may have to add a chapter about it to my book.
Bad news -- the guy who invented cancel culture did some really offensive tweets in 2014

The first cancellation occurred when God cancelled Adam and Eve for eating from the tree of knowledge even though Eve was gaslighted into eating the apple by Satan, suggesting that from the beginning cancel culture was inherently problematic.
this is important. because, in the age of "cancel" culture, we fail to look for the nuance and duality. all survivors of sexual abuse and harassment deserve to have their voices heard. Lisa stepped down because her son may be an abuser.  this is complicated, but also, very real.
@alexandraerin Oh, definitely. I'd also like a transmat beam.  I totally agree that cancel culture is largely a fantasy.

@banji85 @CraigSJ Unilaterally deciding to discontinue supporting a person or brand is fine, but that’s not what cancel culture is. Riling up an anonymous lynch mob on the internet is dangerous for reasons that require far more than 280 characters. It can do good. But it can also be wildly abused.
@CraigSJ I don’t know what you’re referring to specifically, but “cancel culture” is different from “taking a break”. Taking a break implies that there will be reconnection down the line. But when something/someone is cancelled, it’s outta there. I think cancel culture is dangerous.
"Cancel culture" is just the silent treatment. The suggestion that taking a break from people who make you mad is some newfangled internet shit is about the silliest widely accepted idea of our time.

@Bubbameister33 “People criticize decision” can be applied to anything. To cast criticism nebulously as “cancel culture” seems to criticize.... criticism itself. It’s weird and also pointless?

On #CancelCulture, if you didn’t: help advocate for those facing discrimination, donate to our mentoring, homeless, or other programs, stand with us against racist policing, help advance legislation or litigation, you weren’t a ‘supporter.’ Your Twitter ‘unfollow’ means nothing.
Somebody: “I don’t think that “cancel culture” is fair to people who word something a little wrong” Liam Neeson: “Here is the very specific way I wandered the streets hoping to murder any random black guy who looked at me the wrong way because I needed revenge like oxygen.”
Kinda sick of social media. Seeing the ugly side of people you admire is disappointing and even disgusting. It’s beyond “cancel culture”...it’s more loss of leadership. Maybe the illusion is better.
Everyone be loving the “cancel culture” but if you really wanna cancel something, cancel tequila...
Everybody should keep growing. The fact that he looked around for the space to moonwalk today shows you he doesn’t take this whole thing seriously. Cancel culture can certainly go too far but I don’t understand how you pretend he’s shown remorse or growth from med school pics.
Either loud or quiet we suffer and “cancel culture” is toxic but the alternative is... ?
god driving adam and eve out of the garden of eden was truly the genesis of cancel culture
We thing “cancel culture land “ghosting” are buzz words enough for not being kind or decent for being entitled . We look for self acceptance in a box or bottle and it’s again because we’re scared and vulnerable and squishy and hurt about it.

@laurenduca Not responding to "cancel culture" (it's not a thing except a way for people who do wrong to make themselves victims) but I know that as a woc who never in my wildest dreams thought I'd ever go to college I felt really offended that you knocked community college students.
@Blackamazon there is an overt sense of entitlement when white folks complain about cancel culture like "how dare you suggest some ppl should earn a living doing something else". Paradoxically, they rarely consider how the victims of those who've been cancelled had to earn a living/ survive
folks are getting stabbed, noosed, shot, etc and y’all are talking about cancel “culture” with more consideration than canceled LIVES
@Blackamazon also, if we talk in capitalist terms cancel culture is just another form of "the market has spoken". Nobody is obliged to spend their money, time or resources on harmful stuff. Cancelling isn't the death penalty, those people can still lead fulfilling lives outside the public eye
I want folks to be as concerned with the time collapse of these “cancel culture” moments, incidents of violenta and calls for forgiveness
But “cancel culture “ is a buzz word that doesn’t examine power, doesn’t examine who and what gets canceled , who gets to be redeemed and who has people fighting to redeem them versus who doesn’t

This is the problem with cancel culture. Not everything someone does calls for the “accountability” you’re seeking.  I respect Cole because, based on his actions, I have no reason not to.   I don’t have to think like him or agree 100% of the time. That’s okay.

And for clarity, I'm not calling for the end of #CancelCulture -- some trash dumps like R. Kelly and Shaun King should be cancelled.   But I don't think this should always be the go-to. Some just need to fall-back and let others take the lead. #FallBackCulture is about that.
Discussing “cancel culture” with @LolaKeeley_ this afternoon and wondering what youthful position I took that’s most at odds with my current politics. Either catholic school pro-life cell membership or an impassioned defence of Lena Dunham one can still find on my blog I reckon.
I need to find a good piece of writing that describes the difference between reckless #CancelCulture and responding to people who lie or willingly engage in false messages because I see these being conflated.
@VerityJLNelson It seems like a blind spot to me, I’d like to give her the benefit of the doubt in that respect. I’m not a an of drag and cancel culture. But, yeah, it feels uninformed and, actually, unfair to imply to young women that living alone is achievable because, for most, it isn’t.
Welcome to cancel culture @SteveKingIA. Your seat is in the back
In today's #cancelculture, it's so easy to write off celebrities who we feel aren't down for the culture. One of our writers lets us know why he WON'T be canceling the artists participating in the Super Bowl.    https://t.co/pPy6SDwUzs

Only people who should be mad at cancel culture are the people who deservedly need to or got their asses canceled. Caping for Pill Cosby or the King of R&amp;Pee is a fail.
I like the distinction Clarissa makes here between boycotts and cancel culture, which can mean a lot of different things depending on who is talking. I think this is an important political recentering.
Imagine waiting and waiting and waiting for years for justice and right when it seems like it’s on the verge of happening, celebrity stranger bitches decide to lecture you on forgiveness and the banality of cancel culture
But until something besides “cancel culture” is available that prioritizes the ability for a victim to put DISTANCE between them and an abuser ?
The only problem I have with cancel culture is the part where folks try to swarm and cancel you for not thoroughly cancelling the person they cancelled.
Cancel Culture is good.  can it spin out of control? yep. so can water. rainstorm is nourishing, too much is a flood. toxicologists say: the dose makes the poison. Cancel Culture is good...bc it is a powerful tool for marginalized ppl to collectively hold the powerful accountable
@LaziestAmbition this fool made up a whole culture to defend that man. cancel culture. what in the
Video thread. FFS when will the cancel culture catch up with this guy.
And literally "cancel culture" involves no rhetoric about ownership. The outrage against does come down to an erroneous belief that you are owed support no matter what you do. That's not how any of this works. Solidarity is not sacrificing the safety of children to protect adults
This "Cancel culture is bad" routine prioritizes protecting predators above else &amp; you ought to be ashamed of yourself. There's no amnesia in not giving cover to criminal acts against children.
What you just described is not “cancel culture”, furthermore this sounds like you’d be a Bill Cosby or R Kelly apologist with this logic.
@elharaty This person is being portrayed as the victim of cancel culture.  I figure that we can find out what's in our file. I got 99 problems and a snitch aint one.
I'm very much for abolition culture. I don't believe cancel culture serves us in the end bc who the hell gon be left to fight? I'm just highly suspicious of how these conversations are unfolding always around cishet men with power and access.
Yes there are some exceptions but overall... cancel culture makes me sick! 🤷🏾‍♂️
So all those millenials/ Genexers dedicated to #CancelCulture : You canceling Chloe × Halle for performing at the Superbowl ? Gonna stop watching @grownish ? Just curious
People have every right to divest from you if they can no longer trust you. And owe you no other reason other than that.  Cancel culture has nothing to do with it.  💔

Folks like to pretend “cancel culture” is new when ya’ll know damn well your Mama cut off cousin Lisa 20 years ago for who knows what  reason &amp; Lisa ain’t been to a family function since. 🧐🤷🏽‍♀️
@nipsey @yellowbang that's a bullshit ass lie. There is no "cancel culture"
Someone needs to do a research on cancel culture and its effect on the cancelled.
@BiodeYTPable I truly don’t anymore. I still check my indirects on social media but that’s because they’re vastly troll free and even if I do get irked I keep it to myself. It’s this growing worldwide “cancel” culture that’s getting me down. I just don’t want to be a part of any of it anymore.
If there were ever a case for cancel culture, it's Logan Paul.
medium take: marginalized ppl aren’t so afraid of cancel culture bc we’ve lived with it for days, the idea if we cross the wrong social line, act wrong in the eyes of others, we risk getting cancelled for a promotion, project, job, gig, scholarship, grant, loan, placement, etc.
i don't like cancel culture &amp; i'm not saying "cancel the weeknd," but these are the kinds of lyrics that fucked me up when i was younger &amp; subconsciously kept me in the closet. so it's important to talk about and say "this is isn't ok"

Some conservative Muslims use concepts such as normative "Islamic values" to create their own version of cancel culture.
Stop weaponizing social justice language and the polarizing nature of “cancel culture” to distract from your fuck up challenge
Cancel culture ain’t ever gonna be legitimized because the bar has never been set for it to be practiced, and the goal posts are consistently moved back to fit arguments where need be.
Chance did an interview saying that he didn't believe R. Kelly's victims because they were black women. People have a right to be angry at that, without being dismissed as outrage/cancel culture. He can apologize and be better, but people don't have to immediately absolve him.
for the record, i don’t fuck with cancel culture because i think people are capable of changing/growth.   but they genuinely have to show that they have evolved.   and they rarely do.
@OhMyMithrandir Honestly people are living on such a hair trigger these days I think it's becoming impossible for them to see the forest through the trees when it comes to cancel culture
The problem with cancel culture is a lot of you MF’s blow whichever way the wind does. You move the goal posts to suit your agendas. NO ONE is being impartial. Everyone’s “facts” are based on personal feelings. Laws / rules / regulations should NEVER be dictated by feelings.
See that’s the thing, I’m not asking you cancel anyone. I’m not part of cancel culture. You can’t cancel anyone or anything, period. But you sure as hell can talk about it and express how you feel.
dear cancel culture,   understand numbers are numbers any brand, company, artist etc you mention whether negative or positive you're still generating analytics/numbers.
@CushKobain People are only woke on Twitter. We know this hahaha the cancel culture never cancels anyone.. Robert Sylvester Kelly is laughing straight to the bank...
@jenyourfantasy Like I said. Someone is getting paid. You know cancel culture does nothing but give the person(s) more of a platform. In this Era any publicity is good pub
Why are we obsessed with teaching people a lesson.    Why must every misstep come with punishment.   Why are we pushing cancel culture   Why do we seek to ostracize people  We make mistakes and expect forgiveness. Why can't we extend the same olive branch to others.
So sorry... we aren’t “canceling” Chappelle. This cancel culture is getting on my last nerves. #ISaidWhatISaid  https://t.co/h0FDK6cRih

Opinion: making fun of stuff is okay. Making fun of people and their life preferences is okay. If you don’t like it or get offended, that’s also okay. But “cancel culture” is highly questionable and probably not okay. You have every right to tune out and not support. Try that.
@heyDejan One hundred percent agree! I wrote a piece for 1972 about cancel culture, and how it makes me super uncomfortable.
@LaurynIpsum I'm not usually one for cancel culture, but I'm good with never hearing his comedy or supporting it again at this point.
In a spot of good news, Cancel Culture realized it needed to become Self-Cancel culture and that “Driving while Black” needed to be replaced with “Breathing while White” in order to become fully intersectional. Also 2x3 = a chicken &amp; “War and Peace” is now renamed “War is Peace.”

Cancel culture is a bunch of fools, pretentious fools, full of ego &amp; extremism to make sure the world fits into their narratives, if anyone ever said I am cancelled I will go outside &amp; throw stones at walls physically because I will never be cancelled by an avatar &amp; retweets
I think “cancel culture” is a thing because these times are so emotionally taxing &amp; the list of people deserving of our care &amp; consideration is so ever-expanding that people find genuine relief when they can actually remove someone from that list
@EvilMarsupials That's a perfect example though. There's no canceling Ariana Grande. People complain about "cancel culture" but it's a myth. And a lot of celebs become even more famous/make more money because of their "personal" lives. They could be private but they aren't for a reason.
Because this is hard I'm taking another day to consult with everyone involved and be the biggest support I can be to them. Desperately trying to navigate this outside of cancel culture; it's so toxic to say goodbye forever to an entire scene. I've been there. Never again.

when cancel culture meets the desperation to generate clicks, folks
@robynkanner Like, for me, I think there is a difference bw cancel culture and asking a public figure to address words that mean something to a lot of people. Words matter a lot, and we do grow, like you said, and none of us is pure, but we have to own our shit and address them
@robynkanner I tend to agree on cancel culture but I found his apology entirely lacking in substance and full of toxic defensiveness. I always think it’s how you handle a mistake that builds character. And using an MLK quote to air out grievances and make himself a victim was lame IMO
@IamGMJohnson Accountability and exhaustion are certainly warranted. This is a question more about "cancel culture" and what it means, if anything.
@GeekyFemNia @angryblkhoemo Maybe Hart isn't the best example. His botched apology was half-ass. I get that. He hasn't demonstrated remorse, but cancel culture swiftly does away with ignorant folks,  but do we want them to stay ignorant, and if you think it's not our job to teach, I fully get that too.

This is not about people pleasing although I do think the cancel culture on Twitter is having an impact on activism, but how does an activist actually get what they want? Or do activists just continue protesting, marching and dragging people?

The Misplaced Hysteria About a ‘Cancel Culture’ That Doesn’t Actually Exist -- by @daniecal  https://t.co/1UBifLIGt4

@COLDGAMEKELV OMGGGGG  SUPER glad to see you post dude holy shit i was worried  cancel culture is so vicious. glad to see you back
@reinastarmie @dlchandler123 Is anyone surprised? Even with supposed cancel culture no one ever actually gets cancelled.   I assume mans said he doesn't rock with that stuff anymore? And moves on
YouTuber @Boogie2988 was kicked off a Dungeons &amp; Dragons charity stream called RPGSports on Twitch after LGBTQ allies complained about his presence on the show, alleging that he committed abuse, harasses and spews hate. It's crap. It's cancel culture.  https://t.co/HyZHTXAxwf

In 2018 cancel culture is so strong that people are obsessed with finding someone to cancel or be mad at. Even if that means digging through their accounts to find tweets that date back to when they were children. Again, go outside and get some sun light. There is more to life.
@aishaonearth not that he wasn’t serious (the tweets were awful don’t get me wrong) but he was a child when he tweeted those things...cancel culture completely dehumanizes us and strips us of the concept of growth

Cancel culture is fucking wack 😂
this "cancel culture" shit really corny
I hope this Brother Nature situation exposes what cancel culture is truly about. It’s not about justice. It’s about jealousy. Bored losers taking down successful people out of pure envy.

Yeah this cancel culture shit weird.   Mainly cause the jury’s hands are just as dirty.
I think people can say "what I said was fucked up. I have learned why this is fucked up and am glad I am not that person anymore." and we can allow that growth to happen. I am scared cancel culture does not care about growth. Especially for poc youth
Cancel culture is really just a cognitive dissonance tracker.
@blaqueword Thank you💜  I do think it’s an important issue, I just don’t think cancel culture works the way we believe it does.  I want people to actually be heard  instead of their pain serving as social metric hits that boost careers.
Do you think cancel culture actually helps or harms?
A year ago, we were on the other end of cancel culture, people were cancelling us due to tweets from 7 years ago when someone was a child. I think cancel culture lacks a lot of nuance. Culture is always changing and so is dialogue and slang.
In regards to the Brother Nature situation, I do think cancelling is important for growth especially when the person tweeted something when they were a child but sometimes I think cancel culture doesn't give people room to grow.
I woke up at 2pm to this entire app talking about cancel culture and veneers
The flip side of people crying “fake outrage” or decrying “cancel culture” is everyone so quick to say a career being “ruined” I assure you they’re fine I mean who ever *truly* got cancelled?

@tunjiige I've voiced that this was less about her or any celeb/figure and more about the systems that put this in place&amp; we dismiss/ enable them. I don't subscribe to cancel culture, so I agree on that end. But when critique is thought of as hating or canceling, that's where I don't agree

Support/forgiveness are very complicated things often tethered to a lot of personal experiences. The thing I find myself most interested in about current cancel culture is this “cancelled by proxy” phenomenon that’s presented as virtue but it’s really just a superiority fetish.
I think I'm reaching a point where I'm really against cancel culture (with few exceptions tbh). I don't think it's necessarily noble to avoid things because someone told you they were bad. Form your own opinion. It might still be bad but at least you'll know.
while i do believe that cancel culture is unsustainable we are living in a world of bullshit and “fake news” accusers and climate change deniers and r*pe apologists and frankly i just do not want to hear some people speak anymore

I get that men are frustrated with cancel culture (as am I) and men who badly screw up being written off forever. The problem is that so few apologies seem sincere or like they're coming from a place of those men actually understanding how they are responsible for their actions.
@GOROBERT1987 @killabh @GrassRoutesPod Yeah to a certain extent. Cancel Culture is never truly cancelling. For some sure but a majority, nah.

way more articles written about how bad "cancel culture" is than number of people actually cancelled.
The saddest part of call out/cancel culture is... we can never REALLY get anyone out of the paint. We just force them to fall back for a while or take a paid vacation/sabbatical after which they will be welcomed back with open arms... when they were supposedly "over". Sickening.
Never subscribed &gt; Cancel culture
Don’t confuse setting and maintaining boundaries with this “cancel culture” criticism y’all love to throw around.
Cancel culture is so complicated and undermined by the fact that there’s a new person to cancel each day.  For me a lot of it is rooted in fear. I’m committed to personal ideas of what justice/equality look like but afraid it isn’t coming and afraid that I don’t how to get it
Fans and media pin the outrage on "PC culture" / "cancel culture" bloodlust, as if people turned off by artists' shitty takes are at fault when someone who aspires to be famous is too thick in the head either to be decent online or to scrub the damn tweets from when they weren't.
@noyokono Selective cancel culture. Men seem to be excluded 🤔🤷🏾‍♀️
Extreme cancel culture can be annoying but no one's more annoying than the intensely anti-cancel club. Like, nobody said YOU had to be offended. Keep supporting whoever you want to support, captain save-a-hoe.
@bxnstxvxns i don't use the word any kind of ways, so i can't cosign that idea. and "cancel culture" is an imaginary construct. people always caught flak for saying dumb shit in public.

@L_Gordito All I’m saying is have that conversation. I was clear in that I was responding *specifically* to the use of an out of context tweet to prove a point.   Why not reach out to @Luvvie + have that broader conversation if it matters to you ? I’m saying “cancel” culture is dangerous.
Sabrina Claudio just sold out her LA show in minutes, cancel culture doesn’t fucking exist word to my good sis River.
I’m 100% here for learning from others and admitting it if I’m wrong about something. I will do that. But I’m no longer here for being scared of when someone might start a war or bring in “cancel culture” because I just really can’t do it anymore
when did “cancel culture” become the new love &amp; forgiveness? when did social media become a toxic cesspool of hate? for a rt? for a like? it makes me sad for this new generation. life is lived irl, not on an app. ❤️
👌🏽 I love that it now has a name: "Cancel Culture". 😁
“cancel” culture ignores the nuances of the human existence. and also, renounces redemption and forgiveness. and that is a dangerous combination. no one wants to have the hard conversations. and those are exactly the things we need to get to the root and heart of matters at times
also a disclaimer: *calling out* shouldn’t always mean ATTACKING, which I’ve noticed people do on here a lot (and even I’m guilty of). There’s a difference between asking someone to check themselves versus “cancel culture” where you outright attack other women
I moderated a panel last night and during a conversation about "cancel culture" and the possibility of being "uncanceled," an audience member asked for an example of someone being "uncanceled." Me: "Don Lemon."
Wrote about cancel culture, Rosanne Barr, Aziz Ansari, James Gunn &amp; how shoddy journalism deliberating the nature of ppl who accept &amp; repent for singular fuck ups is diff than forgiving ppl who blatantly spread falsehoods &amp; horrific beliefs for yrs &amp; never grow, change, or own it
honestly i'm just gonna say it: cancel culture is cancelled

#BoycottTrevorNoah: “Cancel Culture” And The Underhanded Search for Jesus  https://t.co/1WVsuX7FfF  https://t.co/vZBXVuQSgN
"cancel culture" is my least favorite part of the internet. Punishing people for who they were instead of who they are is an unfair double standard. What is happening to James &amp; so many others online is a shortcoming of the industry. How do we evolve if we don't let people grow?  https://t.co/bfqjJNTWfK
@RyobeatPeach I also wonder if cancel culture leads to harmful behaviors/beliefs becoming more insidious by becoming hidden.   Agree on tricky situations where behavior involves another party/victim: Then you have the evaluate the cost to the victim while you're troubleshooting bad behavior.
Shoutouts to @zomb34n for coining the term "cancel culture" (at least that's where I snagged it from). So fitting.
I worry that cancel culture leaves no room for incentives to grow and improve as a person. At the same time, some people really need to get cancelled. Wonder how we'll navigate this fine line as a society immersed in social media, where context is stripped and news travels fast.
Look, James Gunn's tweets were disgusting. But he apologized. YEARS ago.  At what point do we realize that people mature and it's unfair to crucify them for past sins they've owned up to?   Cancel culture is trash.
@SyedDaniyalAhm1 and thus cancel culture carries value in that sense, because it makes the cost of empathising only with those close to you much higher.
Of course, it is scary and open to abuse and I’d hate to face it. But cancel culture has political and intellectual value because of the very real, material discomfort it causes.
Cancel culture forces you to have guilt about sneakily listening to an old song or reading an old post by someone problematic. It forces you to contend with a more realistic morality.
Cancel culture forces us to realise that any sort of support or approval in a capitalist society leads to material benefits for those involved. A positive tweet is monetisable, as is a Facebook like, as is the decision to stream a song.
I don’t disagree entirely with such assessments. But one thing that I keep coming back to is that cancel culture forces us to consider our consumption as a consequence.
I wanted to put down some (scattered) thoughts on “cancel culture”. I thought of doing a blog, but who tf blogs anymore?  Khair I’ve heard people across the political spectrum complain that "cancelling" people is negative, that it leads to witch hunts and can be very destructive.

"That underscores the real tension endemic to contemporary cancel culture: It’s possible to be canceled and thrive at the same time."   https://t.co/4NQif7yOJr
This is why cancel culture is dangerous. It’s a zero sum game that champions apathy while shunning empathy, refusing human error and eliminating nuanced discourse. All of these things are essential to humanity. If we let them go, we risk letting ourselves go. We can't be that
@anthoknees I’m all about accountability, and how support enables behavior. But I’m also concerned about the way that cancel culture works these days, and how we’re often more focused on throwing people away instead of looking at causality to actually resolve these issues in an authentic way
Also this is why when people tell me about “cancel culture “ and frankly “transformative justice” I keep it teh fuck pushing . Folks stil havent grokked basic victim support but are quick to want to keep the  problematic

@ArtisteRenee but you know how the game goes. ppl cancel her, yeezy, chris brown, r kelly, any of them.....until they release a new song that they don't wanna feel bad liking. this cancel culture been an illusion for most folks.
Cancel culture is more about public performance than anything else.   Most cancelled artists are continuing to get streams, downloads, and sales from those who publicly cancelled them.
This “cancel” culture where people like to grandstand on how they don’t or won’t support someone/something because of past transgressions is tiresome, but when it moves to disavowing other people for not feeling the same as you it’s particularly dull.
And that’s what gives me night sweats that’s the part of “call out/ cancel culture “ that folks miss . It’s why asking “ how do I make my (party/movement/ platform) better over “what do you need to be her” is such a bad question #metoo #timesup

Finally. Cancel culture. People have populated the net, these platforms etc with info especially about diverse identities and experiences. The amplification of these means that some of this knowledge is becoming mainstream and ignorance is harder to claim and forgive.
Let me say a few things real quick: about having faves/being a fave, the ways in which privilege weaponises and strengthens ego, on being humble and listening in order to learn, and the cancel culture as a sign of growing power. Leggo /Mini-thread
@Philip_Cosores i think that... you are de-legitimizing perfectly sensible reasons people have been mad at JT, Katy, &amp; Taylor by painting people out to be bloodthirsty think piece warriors &amp; i'm suspicious of any serious suggestions of a cancel culture when everyone's album still does just fine.
@JasmynBeKnowing Cancel Culture outrages me to no end. People are so quick about it.
Really appreciated this commentary as I navigate my own thoughts on accountability, justice, and "cancel culture" re: sexual harassment and/or assault, as well as sexually inappropriate behaviors.  https://t.co/g4HvSOeHSu
I am concerned about this cancel culture. I’m all for the accountability of Don Lemon,but we truly don’t allow for Black folk to fuck up, learn from it, and grow.  https://t.co/zvECrKpV4k
Thinking about how the whole "cancel culture" convo is goofy because it treats people quitting a TV show or a musical artist for moral/philosophical reasons like some newfangled internet behavior when it's not.
I’ve been thinking a lot about this over the break, especially of call-out and “cancel culture,” the portrayal of “wokeness” as “perfection” rather than active, hard work that requires dialogue, apology, constant learning.   This was good food for thought.  https://t.co/jYHccslhIA
I really don't get cancel culture. When someone steps out of their lane and speaks on things they don't know about they get canceled. But then y'all cancel folks for supposedly not speaking out on everything under the sun. You have to pick a side.
I love @THEkarliehustle’s #BrutallyHonest podcast, and this was episode on Cancel Culture is my favorite so far.  https://t.co/pbBU6GBdUU
Hey, you Cancelers listennnnnn and switch your life up  Listen to Episode 24: [The Cancel Culture] by @THEkarliehustle #np on #SoundCloud  https://t.co/QHnNHFJaUM
A friend and I were chatting about this recently. Cancel culture, 24/7 outrage &amp; the draggers. We both agreed that Twitter has become this thing designed to make ppl seem smarter/cooler/better. It’s f defeating. I miss the old v. Karlie talks about alladat here.👂🏾  https://t.co/qocgB9tQBV
@mlevram Super normalized due to the casual and cavalier way in which 45 tweets. Then add all the men strapping on capes for other men about sexual misconduct, "cancel" culture when people say one wrong thing... it's a lot. On a regular basis. There likely is a limit one's brain can take.
@brianmrosenthal @MWatkinsTrib I wholeheartedly agree that the whole twitter "cancel culture" seriously needs to be rethought.
A big part of abuse is how some survivors blame themselves for what happened &amp; project that onto other survivors.  Instead of talking about that yall "cancelled" her.  Cancel culture is fucking stupid &amp; the people who participate in it are performative self-righteous dickheads.  https://t.co/EJli8Ya6x3
Ya'll was ready to drag me by my edges when I suggested that we chill out with that cancel culture. I figured she needed room and space to unpack harmful thinking. Turns out the root of it was a lot deeper.  https://t.co/HvBaQkrnam
"cancel culture" is like "callout culture" evolved to be a bit better, like, fans (or ex-fans) understand better where to draw the line versus just cringe. it's like we know when to use james corden lightly gesturing vs tyra banks shouting and I think this is a good step for us
One day I will write a full piece on my thoughts of cancel culture. Until then I'm done breaking it down via social media. It's exhausting to keep explaining the same thing 5011 times.  https://t.co/PUgrrXYPJ7
@Miss_NicciC Cancel culture is dumb
When I used the phrase "cancel culture" I thought it was implied who my target audience was.  https://t.co/iAUdRvkqjY
Let's talk "cancel culture." Personally, I am willing to give a lot of grace to young Black girls simply because the world doesn't. I wasn't born reading bell hooks. I had to grow. So does Gabby Douglas. And so do some of you.
Also, can we talk about "cancel culture" with us? At what point do we allow people room to grow and make mistakes?  https://t.co/MdAaXQQKaE
Man, I've been talking about this for YEARS.   "Cancel culture" is nothing more than pedantic, condescending, faux-woke BULLSHIT.  https://t.co/Nbk1Pcpc3n
